It was one of the first things I learnt to cook on my own and managed to get me through some tight university days, when all I could afford to eat was noodles that cost 6p (because I'd spent all my money on alcohol!). I remember looking at the recipe on the back of the packet and making the decision to try cooking them differently because I didn't like how watery they were. This goes against what ramen is, but I didn't like the soup that came with instant ramen, I wanted the concentrated flavour on the noodles only. So I experimented until I found the perfect amount of water to add to the noodles, to allow the packet's seasoning to coat each noodle for maximum flavour (for those of you that are wondering it was 100ml of water, which really isn't a lot).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/455a67e3fcee06500c6c3bab1ba9c002/48a11/batchelors-super-noodles.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Batchelor&#39;s Super Noodles\"\n        title=\"Batchelor&#39;s Super Noodles\"\n        src=\"/static/455a67e3fcee06500c6c3bab1ba9c002/48a11/batchelors-super-noodles.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/455a67e3fcee06500c6c3bab1ba9c002/aca85/batchelors-super-noodles.jpg 163w,\n/static/455a67e3fcee06500c6c3bab1ba9c002/0954f/batchelors-super-noodles.jpg 325w,\n/static/455a67e3fcee06500c6c3bab1ba9c002/48a11/batchelors-super-noodles.jpg 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Since my childhood days I've improved somewhat in my cooking. When I was 17 I worked in Duttons Winebar in Chester, as a prep chef, and then worked in The Living Room in both Chester and Liverpool, as a commis chef. When I met my wife, whilst in university, I remember cooking her a 3-course meal for the first time and being blown away by the joy she got from eating the food I'd cooked. From that point on I knew that I wanted to challenge myself to cook much more interesting dishes.</p>\n<p>Along my culinary adventures I fell in love with Japanese cuisine. I couldn't help but be attracted to delicious sushi, which is everywhere in the world now; sashimi, pure and unadulterated fish; and ramen, the nostalgic noodle that started me on my journey into umami heaven. Japanese cuisine is an art form, which is based on the Power of Five, in short, all 5 senses should be reflected in the meal that is prepared, e.g. there should be 5 tastes: salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami (that delicious savoury flavour found in meats and cheeses); and 5 colours: white (rice), brown (mushrooms), yellow (egg yolk), red (radish) and green (spring onions); amongst the other 3 senses as well. It's a wonderful and healthy way to live your life and I recommend everyone try it. For more in depth information checkout <a href=\"http://www.savoryjapan.com/learn/culture/power.of.five.html\">The Power of Five</a>.</p>\n<p>After Japan I moved onto other cuisines such as Vietnamese and Thai and these days I hardly cook any Japanese. However, I was recently introduced to a programme on Netflix called 'The Mind of a Chef', where the chef is a guy called David Chang, i.e. this guy:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 482px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/07c4075d15ff6ce8033fb37285c70268/81002/david-chang.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61.82572614107884%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"David Chang\"\n        title=\"David Chang\"\n        src=\"/static/07c4075d15ff6ce8033fb37285c70268/81002/david-chang.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/07c4075d15ff6ce8033fb37285c70268/aca85/david-chang.jpg 163w,\n/static/07c4075d15ff6ce8033fb37285c70268/0954f/david-chang.jpg 325w,\n/static/07c4075d15ff6ce8033fb37285c70268/81002/david-chang.jpg 482w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>David owns a restaurant called Momofuku and after watching how excited <em>he</em> was getting about ramen, my nostalgic love affair with the noodle was back! So, I've decided to set myself a challenge of cooking one ramen dish a week for a whole year, blogging the recipe and my experience and understanding as much as I can about the art of ramen.
