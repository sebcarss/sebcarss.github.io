# Year of Ramen #18: Bacon and Eggs Hangover Ramen

<div>

## The hazy morning after

<div>Ramen is a wonderful treat that can sate your appetite, bring peace to your mind and cure a hangover. Given a little TLC you can do anything with a good ramen, however, today is not a day that I want to give my ramen a bit of TLC. Today is a day I want my ramen to give me some TLC, a day to do nothing and be proud of it, and a day to overcome the dreadful state that has become of me. So this post is all about how to make the laziest and most lovingly caressing ramen for those with a tender head and a delicate stomach.</div>

## **Today I will do nothing**

</div>

<div>To accomplish something as beautiful, as mouthwatering and as sensational as a ramen without lifting a finger is probably akin to being a zen master or a Jedi. However, I am neither of these (although not for lack of trying!) so I will have to work extremely hard at being lazy today. So, how does one cook lazily? Well if you're anything like me then I'm sure at some point in your life you've reached for a few ingredients from the fridge and just put them in some bread because it makes a snack; or maybe you are the type to just pick up the phone and order a pizza; or maybe you just grab a packet of crisps and slowly fold them into your oesophagus hoping that your stomach will do the work that your mouth can't gather the energy to do. What ever your method, I would salute your lack of enthusiasm, if only I could be bothered to do so. The moral of this short interlude into the passive life of the hungover beast is that this ramen will involve as little effort as possible but still make you feel as light as a sakura blossom floating in the April wind.</div>

## **What is to hand?**

<div>Making a ramen is a labour of love, however that doesn’t mean that it can’t be done quickly and easily and still taste good. It just means that by substituting certain ingredients you’ll get a less-than-par result, don’t fret though, for the hungry, hungover chappy, a less-than-par ramen is better than no ramen at all. Check that out for a zen quote! Psst… Master Oogway has nothing on me!</div>

<div>Hmm… so what is in the fridge today that I can pick? Well, I need a broth so I will start with a chicken stock (from a cube, obviously), and as it’s in my cupboard, some dashinomoto, which by the way, you should definitely order, it tastes great for occasions where you don’t have the time, patience or inclination to make a dashi stock from scratch (which for me is when it’s mid-week and I just want a ramen fill!). Secondly, I need to look at what the tare should be. I would like to say miso but that involves more stirring than I’d like, to break up the paste, so I think I’ll go with soy sauce, mirin and sake - they are like a golden trio of deliciousness. Maybe some garlic and ginger powder will go nice in there too, if I’ve got them. I’ve never tried adding powder instead of the real stuff before but a little should lift the broth slightly. For this ramen I’ll stick with plain old egg noodles as they are simple to cook as they don’t require much attention like somen and soba do.</div>

## **And to top it all off**

<div>Finally I need to pick some toppings. No hangover cure can be complete without eggs so I’m going to whack on the sous-vide as it’s by far the easiest way to cook eggs and results in a delicious egg, which doesn’t require peeling - I’m not going to bother with cutting the egg in half, it’s going on top whole and will stand proud in the middle of a noodle nest. What goes with eggs and hangovers in Britain? Why bacon of course! I would never leave bacon off a hangover ramen! It’s a British tradition to wake up to the smell of bacon sizzling away under the grill. Therefore, I’m getting some crispy streaky bacon in this bad boy to arouse my senses into the life of the living again. So, what’s left? Well, we need some green in there, and also one of the best ingredients to add to a ramen in my opinion… spring onions, granted I will have to cut these but I think it's worth the effort. I can already feel this is going to be a winner.</div>

# Bacon and Eggs Hangover Ramen

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 500ml chicken stock (from a cube, don't put extra pressure on yourself today)
* 500ml dashi stock (use 5g dashinomoto, i.e. one sachet)

_the tare:_

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sake
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp ginger powder

_the toppings:_

* 2 eggs
* 4 spring onions
* 4 rashers of streaky bacon

_the noodles:_

* 2 packs of egg noodles

## Method

1. Turn the sous-vide on and warm it up to 63C. When it beeps, pop the eggs in and leave for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. When the eggs have 10 minutes left turn the grill on and start cooking the bacon until nice and crisp. Then take the bacon out and cut into pieces.
3. Meanwhile, boil the kettle and make the broth out of the chicken stock cube and the dashinomoto. Then add the broth and the tare to a pan, season to taste and keep warm.
4. Boil the noodles until cooked, then drain and divide between two bowls.
5. Sprinkle the bacon bits all over the noodles.
6. Chop the spring onions and sprinkle all over the noodles as well.
7. Take the eggs out of the sous-vide and peel the bulbous end so that you can pour out the egg onto the noodles, in the centre. Take a knife and nick the egg to allow some of the lovely yolk to ooze out.
8. Carefully pour the broth into the bowls, sprinkle over chilli flakes (optional) and then serve in front of your favourite boxset.

This was just what I needed to give me a lift today. A perfect hangover cure and easy to make, although it did take 2 hours in total (granted the two hour time was due to the egg cooking itself up a treat in the sous-vide). The addition of the bacon was fantastic, I can't imagine this ramen without it. Using streaky bacon and making the bacon crisp up to an almost burnt state made a massive difference - no one wants a limp rasher!

I've got to admit something... I was supposed to add garlic and ginger powder, but due to my overall lethargic state I forgot! Oh well, I've left it in the recipe because I think it will work well. So if you don't fancy experimenting on my behalf then leave it out. I will give it a go at some point... maybe tomorrow as I have loads of bacon rashers to use up now. Ah, first-world Japanese problems.
