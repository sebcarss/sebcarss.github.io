# Year of Ramen #16: Summer Sun Tsukemen

## Ramen noodles and summer

I can honestly say that I will demolish a ramen at any time of the year, it is immensely satisfying to slurp up some noodles and leaves me feeling incredibly sated. However, there are times of the year when the weather becomes glorious, the knees come out and the thought of drinking a steaming hot bowl of broth becomes less appealing. The British know that when the sun's out one doesn't cook a roast dinner with all the trimmings and a big glug of gravy. It turns out that the Japanese have the same concerns about their beloved national dish and have created a variation on the traditional bowl of ramen that is more appealing in the hot and humid climate they have. This ramen is known as _tsukemen_ and it means "dipping noodles".

## What is Tsukemen?

Tsukemen involves two bowls, one filled with a hot broth and the other filled with cold noodles and toppings. The cold noodles are then dipped into the broth and slurped up in the usual way, the only difference is that instead of a steaming bowl of soup you have some nice cold noodles to slurp, which sounds much more appealing already. The broth needs to be slightly stronger than the usual ramen broth to make sure that it imparts enough of its flavour when dipped, but by all accounts it can be quite easy to overpower the noodles, so the Japanese appear to have two ways around this conundrum. First, they use slightly thicker noodles so that there is less surface area for the broth to stick to, and secondly, when eating the tsukemen, they make sure to pick up a small amount of noodles at a time. Of course this doesn't stop you from choosing any noodle you want, that's one of the beauties of cooking ramen, it can entirely be based on personal preference and is not set in stone like other recipes are. The tsukemen is already evidence of this as the dish is not really like a ramen, if anything it is a deconstructed ramen, which is more akin to the British having an open sandwich.

## The extra mile

As an added bonus, in Japanese tsukemen restaurants you can ask for _soup-wari_, which is basically a simple stock that you can pour into your strong broth to reheat and thin out so that you can then drink the broth at the end of the meal. This is of course not mandatory but by Jove it does sound like a grand old idea. The chef has spent all this time making a wonderfully delicious broth for you to eat and this is a way to make it palatable after all the noodles have gone, so you can get one last blast of the chef's incredible dish. I love the idea!

## When it gets really hot!

Tsukemen comes with a hot broth and if the weather outside is too hot to even handle tsukemen in its purest form then fear not, the Japanese have come up with an even cooler dish. It is known as _hiyashi tsukemen_ and consists of a bowl of cold noodles and a bowl of cold broth to dip them into. Initially I thought this sounded a bit strange but I have a cookbook called [The Japanese Kitchen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Japanese-Kitchen-Essential-Ingredients-Authentic/dp/1856269701/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1468905578&sr=1-1&keywords=the+japanese+kitchen) by Kimiko Barber and in that book there is a dish called _hiyashi __somen_, which is basically cold somen noodles served with a broth made of dashi, mirin and soy sauce, and it is truly delicious, so I figured this would actually also be very tasty indeed and a must try during the brief summer in Britain. For the ramen in this blog though I will be sticking to a more traditional tsukemen with a hot broth.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_The broth:_

* 1l chicken stock (reserve 500ml for soup-wari)

_The tare:_

* 2 tbsp tahini
* 1 tbsp genmai miso
* 2 tbsp mirin
* 2 tbsp sake
* 2 garlic clove, bashed
* 2x 1 inch round of ginger

_The toppings:_

* 4 spring onions, chopped
* 1 lg chicken breast, sliced thinly
* 1 lg carrot, sliced on the diagonal
* 6 chestnut mushrooms, sliced

_The noodles:_

* 2 packs of soba noodles

## Method

1. Cook the soba noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes and then drain and refresh under cold water to stop the cooking process.
2. Add the miso to a tumbler and then pour a little stock in and use a fork to mash out the lumps. Then add this to a pan with all the stock and tare ingredients. Make sure you only use 500ml stock at this point and reserve the other 500ml for soup-wari. Gently heat to keep warm but don't boil.
3. Add the carrots to a pan and boil for 5-7 minutes. You want the carrots to retain some bite but not be too crunchy. Then drain and set aside ready for displaying.
4. Add some butter and olive oil to a pan and cook the mushrooms briefly on a high heat with some cracked black pepper before adding the chicken. Stir-fry the ingredients until the chicken is cooked.
5. Place the cold noodles into a bowl and then add the carrots, chicken and mushrooms on top.
6. Pour the broth into a separate bowl and then add the spring onions.
7. Add the rest of the stock to a small bowl to be used as soup-wari.

It was simple to make, relatively quick and had a delicious sesame note to it that sated my hunger without the feeling of being bloated, which traditional ramen can sometimes give. The inclusion of the soba noodles was a late addition but I think it worked really well with the broth because the noodles were slightly thicker than egg noodles so helped with limiting the amount of broth picked up. I randomly stumbled upon them at the supermarket in the Japanese aisle (ok, stumbled is the wrong word, I was searching for fun Japanese stuff) and I figured these would do, especially because they are already pretty much cooked.

I was a little concerned with the broth when I first made it because it was a little overpowering when tasted on its own but I persevered in the name of science and found that a strong broth really is the way to go. Dipping the noodles in to the broth imparted the flavour of the broth but didn't leave a bad taste in the mouth. Think of the broth in the same way as making a vinaigrette, you want it to be too strong to the taste because its strength will be limited when added to all the other ingredients.

The broth was still strong even with the additional stock and was a little too bitter for me. Also, I was full by this point and drinking a pint of stock didn't really seem like something I wanted to do. From what I have read this is an additional extra for the tsukemen lover but it is by no means a requirement. Maybe there are broths that are better suited to additional soup-wari or maybe its just down to personal preference. Either way it won't stop me from attempting a better soup-wari next time.
