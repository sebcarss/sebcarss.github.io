# Year of Ramen #08: Breakfast Ramen from Kitakata

Morning is a sacred time in my household. My wife wakes up at 7am to a freshly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea; my daughter wakes up at 6:30am and requests a morning cuddle from mummy; and I wake up bright and early at 5am, go through my morning rituals and then do something productive. Back in the day I used to go to the gym for a blast on the weights; further back in the day, I used to go for a run of around 6-8 miles; and even further back in the day I used to cook [onigiri](http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/01/how-to-make-onigiri-japanese-sushi-rice-balls.html), which are kind of like sushi that are made for children's bento boxes in Japan (you are probably familiar with the emoji for this üçô) ¬†- I made these for my lunch and the wife's lunch. More recently though I've been doing things like improving my programming skills, working on a [company talent and development programme](https://appovation.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/shop-directs-outstanding-talent-and-development-programme/) that I'm part of¬†or writing this blog. So, I thought for this post I would spend that morning time¬†taking a step back to the time I used to cook onigiri, and in homage, I would cook a breakfast ramen.

## Who would eat ramen for breakfast?

OK, I have a love for noodles and I don't care whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, as far as I'm concerned ramen can, and should, be eaten any time of the day. In fact one of my favourite nations' breakfast is the Vietnamese Pho, which is beef noodle soup full of pungent mint, basil, coriander and fish sauce... fish sauce, for breakfast? Why not? I don't see why we have to limit ourselves to inoffensive breakfast cereals in the morning; but then I like kedgeree, which again is not really to everyone's taste first thing. The good news for this post is that I'm not the only one who thinks ramen for breakfast is a bad idea, there's this region of Japan called Kitakata, which has around 50,000 people and 120 ramen shops, that's the most ramen shops per head in all the provinces of Japan. These guys love a good ramen, and aren't shy of having a good ramen at breakfast.

## The lighter way to enjoy ramen

The style of ramen that is generally on offer for the early bird is known as _asa-raa_ (which means breakfast ramen) and is a light soy based broth with a few toppings, usually chashu pork, bamboo shoots and spring onion. This type of ramen is in stark contrast to the late night booze-sopping heavy ramen that partygoers love to slurp down before crashing for the night. I can just imagine the state some people come home in at the end of a night, with broth all down their shirt,  it's the Japanese version of a Londoner coming home with turmeric stains down their trousers from a late night curry! Obviously this is not a good look for the businessman on the way to work, let's be honest, it's not a good look for the drunkard either but somehow it seems more acceptable, however a lighter broth is a more sensible option in the morning.

## Set that alarm!

To make a breakfast ramen in the Kitakata style you really have to get up early, chashu just isn't that quick to make, but that doesn't mean it can't be prepared in advance! For this ramen I already have some pulled pork in the freezer so I'm gonna use that instead of the chashu. The bamboo shoots, when I last tried them, were a little tasteless so this time I thought I'd boil them in the broth to add some extra flavour. I'll add some chopped spring onions, simple enough. Finally, I'm gonna go slightly off track from the typical Kitakata ramen and add an egg, because it's breakfast and I just love eggs, and why not, it's Easter after all. As it takes 45 minutes to cook an egg in the sous-vide I'm gonna cook this the night before too, I'll just pop it in the fridge and peel it in the morning to save time. Damn I'm excited about this!

# Breakfast Ramen from Kitakata

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_The broth:_

* 0.5l pork stock
* 0.5l chicken stock
* 1 garlic clove
* 3 tbsp light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp mirin
* Splash of sesame oil

_The toppings:_

* 2 eggs
* 3 spring onions, sliced thinly in rounds
* 150g pressure-cooked pork shoulder (see [this recipe](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/year-of-ramen-03-pressure-cooked-pork-ramen-with-a-shio-broth/) for instructions)
* 50g bamboo shoots from a can, drained

_The noodles:_

* Flat, wide and curly noodles

## Method

1. The night before sous-vide the egg at 63C for 45 minutes, then refresh in iced water for 5 minutes, then drain and store in the fridge.
2. In the morning, gently fry the garlic in the sesame oil for a minute and then add the stocks, soy sauce and mirin and keep at a gentle simmer.
3. Boil the noodles until al dente (they will continue to cook in the broth after serving so you don't want them too soft). Drain and divide between bowls.
4. Meanwhile add the bamboo shoots to the broth to warm through.
5. Fry the pressure-cooked pork in some oil until just crisp.
6. Peel the egg and then slice in two, being careful not to lose much yolk.
7. Add the toppings to the noodles in whatever way you see fit.
8. Serve with an espresso to start your day (optional).

What a way to start the day... an umami-filled bowl of heaven topped off with an espresso of Indian Monsoon Malabar! That should keep me going for a while, although the addition of the garlic to the broth was maybe a bit strong for breakfast and I don't think my colleagues will be impressed with me this morning! Next time I'll remove it and lessen the amounts of soy and mirin so the broth is lighter.

I was very pleased with my eggs this time although, as is usually the case, the egg was pretty old and therefore the white wasn't as tight as I would have wanted it, which caused the egg to be misshapen when presented.

However, the yolk was a lovely gummy texture that, when heated from the broth, changed back into liquid gold. 63C is definitely the way to go when making an egg in the sous vide and making sure the egg is chilled thoroughly before peeling will make that job easier too. My next challenge is finding freshly laid eggs in Liverpool - I may have to invest in some chickens üòä
