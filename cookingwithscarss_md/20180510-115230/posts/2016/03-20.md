# Year of Ramen #07: Vegetarian Yakisoba Inspired Ramen

Last week my wife went away with work to France - to be more specific, Cannes. As is tradition when parents go on a work trip, she brought back a present for our daughter, some gorgeous colourful gifts from a little known shop calledÂ _[Pylones](http://www.pylones.com/en/).Â _Of course I wasn't expecting a gift of my own (honestly ðŸ˜‡) but when my wife turned up she handed me an exotic bag full of excitement and wonder (ok, that's a lie, she told me to go look in the suitcase, but let's not let the truth get in the way of what happened in my head). So anyway, I was handed the bag in the traditional Japanese style, held firmly in two hands, head bowed. I took the bag firmly in both hands and bowed myself, it was a beautiful exchange that showed the respect we have for one another. I then proceeded to peek into the bag and was not disappointed. My wife had scoured Cannes for a Japanese shop and brought me back a treat that couldn't fail to make my heart (and stomach) explode with delight... Yakisoba ramen, in a pot!

**Yakisoba?**

I know what you are thinking, yakisoba is not ramen... I thought the same thing and you'd be right, it's not. Yakisoba is a dish similar to chow mein, in fact it originates from China, likeÂ ramen does, and roughly translates to "fried noodles". It is generally made with ramen noodles and would be served at festivals and as street food. The closest resemblance we have to this in the UK (that I can think of) is the fast-food chain Wok 'n' Go. It's delicious in it's own right but it just ain't ramen. This dish is generally made by frying some vegetables, and maybe some meat or seafood, and then tossing in some noodles and some chuno sauce, which is a spicy, fruit and vegetable sauce, which coats the noodles to impart maximum flavour.Â This gave me an idea, why not create a ramen that was inspired by the way that yakisoba is created? So this post is my experimentation with a new style of ramen.

**Don't forget the Bhuddists**

This is the seventh week of writing my cooking blog and a couple of people have pointed out to me that so far I haven't cooked a vegetarian ramen yet. This was not done on purpose, I just generally eat anything and everything within reaching distance so don't always think about dietary requirements. However, since yakisoba is street food and would usually be made with a few bits of vegetables I figured this would be a good one to go veggie for. This caused me a slight problem though and that is to do with the sauce for the yakisoba.

**Chuno Sauce**

This sauce is supposedly made with a list of ingredients like the following: [tomatoes, prunes, apples, lemon juice, carrots, onions, vinegar, sugar, HFCS, salt, starch, hydrolyzed protein, spices and yeast extract](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/08/condiments-in-japan-so-su-sosu-tonkatsu-bulldog-okonomiyaki-sauce.html). This wasn't something that I was keen on exploring for this recipe so I wanted a cheats version, and after doing a bit of research I found that the best substitute would be a mix of tomato ketchup and Worcester sauce. This is where the problem lies though. Worcester sauce contains anchovies and therefore would make this dish less palatable to my vegetarian friends. After a bit more digging I found another substitute, HP Sauce! This is made from a mixture of [malt vinegar, tomatoes, dates, tamarind, sweeteners and spices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Sauce); which I'm hoping is not too far off chuno sauce as it's vegetarian. Oh well, if it's dreadful, you'll be the first to know.

**The world's gone mad!**

My idea for this ramen is to create a vegetarian broth as well as make yakisoba and then just combine the two, this is surely how all the greats invent new recipes! For the toppings I decided to try some different types of mushrooms, this was mainly because I noticed an 'Asian Mushrooms' selection in my local Tesco that contained enoki, shimeji and king oyster mushrooms. To keep some sort of ramen tradition I decided to cook the mushrooms three different ways: the enoki mushrooms would be boiled in the broth; the shimeji mushrooms would be fried in butter; and the king oyster mushrooms would be grilled with a soy sauce, sugar and lemon juice marinade. Finally, yakisoba is traditionally served withÂ _aonori_, which is nori flakes but as I didn't have any I figured crushing a nori sheet would do... here's hoping it turns out well.

**Ingredients (serves 2)**

_The broth:_

* 1l vegetable stock
* Splash of toasted sesame oil
* 2cm piece of ginger, minced
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 3 tbsp light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp mirin

_The yakisoba:_

* 1/2 white onion, sliced thinly
* 4 leaves of a Chinese leaf cabbage, sliced thinly and stems removed
* 3 spring onions, sliced
* 2 tbsp HP Sauce (alternative brown sauces are available)
* 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce

_The toppings:_

* 1 king oyster mushroom (eryngii), sliced thinly lengthways
* Pinch of brown sugar
* Dash of soy sauce
* Squeeze of lemon juice
* Small bunch of shimeji mushrooms
* Knob of butter
* Small bunch of enoki mushrooms
* Aonori (to garnish), I used 1/2 nori sheet crushed in a pestle and mortar
* Toasted sesame oil, to taste

_The noodles:_

* 2 slabs of medium egg noodles

**Method**

1. Boil the noodles for slightly less than you would normally so that they are a little more than al dente. Drain in a sieve and refresh under cold water to stop the cooking process. Then shake off the excess water and toss in a splash of sesame oil to stop them sticking together.
2. Gently fry the ginger and the garlic in a saucepan with the toasted sesame oil for a minute. You want the aromas to fill the room without any browning occurring. Then add the rest of the broth ingredients and bring to a gentle simmer.
3. Meanwhile, gently fry the shimeji mushrooms in a heavy-based pan with the knob of butter. You want the mushrooms to be soft but without colouring.
4. Mix the brown sugar, soy sauce and lemon juice in a bowl and then brush over the king oyster mushrooms. Place under a grill while cooking the yakisoba ingredients, making sure to keep an eye on them so they don't burn. You want an even browning to occur and to be flipped once. Apply more of the marinade as required.
5. In a wok, on a high heat, add some toasted sesame oil and then fry the onion for one minute, then add the Chinese leaf and the spring onions for another minute. Add the HP Sauce, the oyster sauce and the noodles and stir-fry until the noodles are coated and warmed through, then divide between the bowls. (You haven't forgotten about the king oyster mushrooms have you?)
6. Add the enoki mushrooms to the broth and allow to heat through whilst you plate up the rest of the ingredients.
7. Add the king oyster mushrooms on top of the yakisoba noodles, pour over the shimeji mushrooms and then place the enoki mushrooms on as well.
8. Pour over the broth, then crush the nori sheets and sprinkle on top of the dish to garnish. Finally, add a splash or two of toasted sesame oil on top, which will give the dish a little lift.

Firstly, I like to say that this turned out surprisingly better than I had anticipated: the mushrooms were a delight, each with its individual flavour; the broth had taken on a slightly sharp taste as the flavour of the HP Sauce cut through the broth; and the makeshift aonori imparted a subtle aroma to the dish that was perfect.

On the downside, the colour of the dish was fairly insipid. it was beige, beige and more beige! I think maybe three types of mushroom is too much and will definitely change it for next time. I'd recommend adding some carrot, which is traditionally found in yakisoba, and also adding the tried and trusted egg.
