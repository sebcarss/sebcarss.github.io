# Year of Ramen #21: "Spaghetti" and Meatballs Ramen

## That's amore

So I'm twenty ramen in and I think my wife has officially become sick of ramen - I know, I didn't think that was possible either, which means either I'm in denial and my food is actually terrible or she's a terrible judge of food. I'm sticking to the latter because it's so much fun to be in denial and live life in a swirling twirling noodle love affair! However, this development proposes a challenge, either I continue making ramen dishes that push my wife further away from my dream holiday to Japan or I try to alter the recipes to suit the love of my life. And that's when I struck upon a brilliant idea! My wife is a big fan of Italian cuisine and is especially fond of her mother's insanely good meatballs. She's also a massive Disney fan so I thought if there is any ramen that I could make that would bring her back into the ramen game it's a "spaghetti" and meatball ramen a la Disney.

## Two worlds collide

You may be wondering how am I going to create a wonderful Japanese ramen dish without bastardising the wonderful Italian cuisine, well, to be honest, I don't have a clue either, I'm making this stuff up as I go. However, I do know that both parmesan cheese and tomato, two traditional Italian ingredients, are full of tastebud busting umami. And, I've also recently had a spectacular ramen experience when I added tomatoes to my stock in [Year of Ramen #14: Smoked Aubergine and Pulled Pork Ramen in an Umami-Rich Vegetable Broth](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/year-of-ramen-14-smoked-aubergine-and-pulled-pork-ramen-in-an-umami-rich-vegetable-broth/). And I have it on good authority from a fellow called Nigel Slater that cheese rinds should not be thrown away but should be used to infuse their wonderful flavour into other dishes. So, it surely goes without saying that I could make a cheese and tomato stock out of these wonderful ingredients and these would be both authentic to the Japanese and also respectful to all the Italian mammas out there... and above all else damn tasty!

## Method

1. For the broth first fry the bacon in a pan on its own, then when just browned and a little crispy, remove and put to one side. In the same pan fry the onion, celery and carrot until slightly caramelised, then add the rest of the ingredients and the cold water and bring to a simmer for 30 mins. ![20161215_210059](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/20161215_210059.jpg?w=600)
2. While the broth is cooking make the peppers by chopping the peppers lengthways into 4 pieces, then remove the seeds and pith. Cover in the olive oil and place skin-side up on a rack. Place under the grill, about 3-4inches away from the heat, for about 20 minutes until blackened. Then, using tongs, put the peppers into a zip lock bag and leave for 10 minutes. Take the peppers out of the bag and pinch the skin off, it should come of easily. Then slice into lengths.[gallery ids="2947,2949" type="rectangular"]
3. Meanwhile make the meatballs by combining the pork mince, beef mince, panko breadcrumbs, egg, oregano, dijon and some salt and pepper. Roll into small balls (small enough to be eaten in one mouthful) and set aside until the stock is ready.![20161215_205836](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/20161215_205836.jpg?w=600)
4. Strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve, and then measure 400ml into a clean pan and add the chicken stock. Warm through but do not let boil.
5. In a frying pan add some oil and fry the meatballs, rolling them around to brown all over.
6. Cook your noodles in boiling water for a few minutes, until soft. Then drain.
7. Get your bowls out and add the tare to the bottom of the bowl. Then add the noodles, followed by the meatballs, basil, torn mozzarella and peppers.
8. Light a candle in an old wine bottle (a traditional Chianti bottle is best) and sing Frank Sinatra's That's Amore to your loved one.

Ok so this didn't turn out as planned at all... I personally thought it was quite nice but my wife didn't. She said the flavour was nice but the aftertaste was unpleasant, which I think was down to the parmesan being boiled in the broth. Maybe I should have left that out. Oh well, we live and learn. The broth was the problem here, and the fact that I tried to make a traditional Italian dish in a Japanese way. I figured if I put some chicken stock with it then it would help alleviate the aftertaste but it obviously didn't. What I thought was interesting though was how adding a dashi stock made it taste nicer to me. Well if you consider that dashi has a fishy flavour then it becomes rather strange, but maybe it was the umami powering through that I loved - I didn't share this experience with my wife though, she would not have been impressed.

The meatballs were pretty good. They had a great flavour to them and complemented the dish quite well. Meatballs, cheese tomato and basil will always go well together though so there was no real issue there. One criticism was they were a little bit soggy, maybe a combination of the panko breadcrumbs, egg and fat in the meat but it wasn't that bad. Some room for improvement, that is all.

Surprisingly the mozzarella was good in the mix. I assumed this would be the part where everything would fall down, but it added a creaminess to the broth, which was actually ok. The mozzarella itself was great because it warmed through a treat and became really stringy, yum!

So, not a great experience, but I've learnt that parmesan rinds may not go well in a stock made for ramen. Oh and by the way, those of you that think my measurements are slightly out from the photos, well, I did attempt to make this meal for 6 people instead of two and had to change the measurements afterwards, mainly because a friend of mine wanted a ramen at the same time that I hadn't cooked a ramen for two months - bad me - so I decided to try and make this particular (experimental) ramen, which I had already started thinking about but hadn't made. Anyway, when I tried it I realised it wasn't really for giving to other people (hence the bad photo of the dish - that was a trial run just for me)... I mean, what impression would that really give if I gave a bad ramen to friends when they want a good ramen? So because of this I ended up making more of everything, especially meatballs, but don't worry, they will come in handy some other time. FYI I made my friends the [Year of Ramen #18: Bacon and Eggs Hangover Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/year-of-ramen-18-bacon-and-eggs-hangover-ramen/), which they seemed to like, so all's well that ends well. Oh, and I decided not to recreate the dish for a better photo, it's just not worth it when there is better ramen to be had.

SC.
