# Year of Ramen #24: Christmas Ramen Canapes

## Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine... oh I bloody love Christmas, I really do. It's the most wonderful time of the year! It's a lovely time to spend with your family, cook some delicious food and generally make a fool out of yourself playing party games and getting merry. But, is it a time for ramen? Yes! There is never a time that we should say no to that question, just like that dude in Evolution said "there's always time for lube", in my opinion there is always time for ramen!

## The traditional Japanese Christmas meal

But what do the Japanese eat at Christmas? To answer this question I had to first find out whether the Japanese celebrated Christmas at all. Well, it turns out that they do but not in the conventional way. In fact, they treat it more like we treat Valentine's Day. Christmas Eve is the day for lovers, where they treat each other to a romantic night out on the town and give each other heartfelt presents - from what I can gather, children and family don't necessarily get presents! Christmas Day seems to be a fairly low-key event, however, back in 1974 Colonel Sanders himself created an advert that would cement KFC at the heart of Christmas for Japanese forever. He found that, when foreigners couldn't find turkey anywhere in Japan on Christmas Day, they would get a KFC bucket instead, the next best thing at Christmas, obviously. So he marketed the Christmas Bucket, which caught on massively and now every Christmas, people in Japan prebook their Christmas Bucket, sometimes months in advance, to avoid the queues which can be up to 2 hours long! Oh I do love the Japanese! So it looks like I won't be taking too much inspiration from Japan on my Christmas ramen... instead I'm going to go a little sideways on this one.

## Little morsels of Christmas

When you think of Christmas, you probably think of luxurious potato, roasted to an unfathomable crisp; tender and succulent turkey with a hint of clementine; and the most delicious gravy you can get your lips on! But do you think about noodles? I didn't think so, not many British people do. But why neglect the noodle at Christmas? It can play a part, just as much as the glorified potato. In fact, I have a splendid idea! Christmas is a time for being with friends and family and therefore lots of nibbles. Noodles can also be cooked in such a way so that they form a bun for a burger, so it's stands to reason that they could also be turned into an hors d'oeuvre. Then by placing the left-over Christmas dinner on the noodles you would have a little morsel of Christmas to reignite your tastebuds. But wait, there is something missing... the delicious gravy! Don't worry, to give this a better Japanese feel I will put a little bowl of gravy for dunking with these treats, so that it gives a little tsukemen feel to the dish.

## Crispy turkey skin

Jamie Oliver is known the world over for his generous amounts of lemon, chilli, garlic and olive oil, to the point where he is now known, in certain circles, as Jamie Olive-Oil. This Christmas though he did something that I find truly amazing... he pan-fried some left-over turkey skin for a Christmas risotto that he was making. This sounded like a great idea so I figured I'd do the same. This should add a little crunch to the hors d'oeuvre as well as impart some of the lovely flavour that you get in the skin.

## Ingredients (serves all of your loved ones)

_the broth:_

* [Jamie's get ahead gravy](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/get-ahead-gravy/)

_the noodles:_

* 2 packs of instant noodles
* 2 eggs

_the tare:_

* left-over turkey skin

_the rest:_

* left-over turkey
* left-over stuffing
* left-over bread sauce
* left-over cranberry sauce

## Method

1. Whack your instant ramen in a pan, heat that bad boy up with some boiling water and get those noodles cooked until soft. Then drain them and leave to cool slightly. Then mix with the beaten egg and place into an oiled muffin tin. place some cling film over and then squash down with another muffin tin. Place a heavy object on top and place in the fridge for a couple of hours.![20161228_005345](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/20161228_005345.jpg?w=2048)
2. Take the ramen out of the fridge and fry on a high heat to crisp up. Fry one side for about 3 minutes and then flip for another minute. You want both sides to be browned and crispy. You may have to cool the pan if doing lots of ramen pancakes.
3. Drain the ramen and dab with a paper towel to remove some of the oil. Leave to cool.
4. Meanwhile, fry the turkey skin so that it is nice a crisp. I like to leave it a few minutes on one side before flipping over to crisp up the other side. Then pat it dry with kitchen towel before slicing up to add to the flavour bomb.
5. Spread some bread sauce over the ramen. Add some stuffing, turkey, crispy turkey skin and cranberry sauce.![20161228_005445](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/20161228_005445.jpg?w=2048)
6. Serve with a steaming bowl of delicious gravy to excite your guests tastebuds.

What a pleasant little surprise these were, well I say surprise but what's not to like? There's the perfect mouthful of Christmas laid out on a bed of noodles and dunked in the most delicious gravy you've ever tasted! The noodles were very easy to make and had a similar feel and taste to a blini or a small pancake. They didn't hold too much flavour which meant the topping could really shine through, which is exactly what I want from a nibble.

The noodles had a slightly crisp exterior but were mainly soft, I'm not sure if there is a way to crisp them up better, maybe deep frying them briefly would have done this.Â However, this softness worked in my favour as each bundle of Christmas looked a little too big at first - the size was restricted to the size of my muffin tin. What this meant though was the bundles could be folded slightly to hold the toppings in place whilst it was dunked in the delicious gravy - Win!

The crispy turkey skin was a wonderful idea - thank you, Jamie. One of the best parts of making this was the smell as it was cooking... it brought back all the Christmas smells from when the turkey was roasting. On the noodles it did add a slight crunch, but not too noticeable, this may have been down to my cooking of it though. Jamie's definitely had more of a snap to it when he cooked it. Alas, he is a multitalented celebrity chef and I'm a computer programmer who has a love of cooking.

Merry Christmas everyone. I hope you have enjoyed the holiday and have a noodley New Year.
