# Year of Ramen #23: Sriracha Spiced Chicken Ramen with Pickled Walnuts

## In a pickle

Being a big foodie I will always want to try something that I haven't tasted before, therefore I follow some very simple rules when I go out for a meal:

1. If I don't know what it is, I'll order it
2. If I can't pronounce it, I'll order it
3. If I can't cook it, I'll order it
4. If I can't source the ingredients myself, I'll order it

If none of the above are ticked then I still enjoy the meal because as I said before, I'm a massive foodie, but there's something special about trying something for the first time or being wowed by the creativity and skill that another chef has. Some of my favourite experiences with food include my trip to Kuala Lumpur, on my honeymoon, where I tried abalone and sea cucumber... both of which were delicious, if a little weird looking! Another favourite is from when I went to Devon and had a wonderful seafood platter including welks, winkles, oysters, prawns and a crab...

Unfortunately I was pretty ill after eating this, something about not being killed properly. Anyway, that's not gonna stop me trying new things and it definitely won't stop me having a platter like this again... just maybe not from the same restaurant!

OK, I'm getting very much off topic now. I'm meant to be talking about how a friend of mine came over recently and brought me some pickled walnuts, because he knows how much I like to eat random things. I'm not sure about you but I've never had a pickled walnut, to be honest I didn't even think you could pickle a walnut! Alas it turns out you can and people have been doing it for a while. According to Wikipedia, which never lies, the English have been pickling their walnuts since the early 18th-century! Well, it turns out these walnuts are pretty damn tasty when pickled, as expected they very much taste of malt vinegar. However, their texture is like a slightly firm tofu, which was very surprising. Supposedly you slice these up and put them on some warm, crispy toast with a good strong cheddar, which I did, and of course the flavour was delicious... but that is pretty obvious. Being me though, I decided a pickled cheese toasty is not enough, instead a pickled walnut ramen would have to be created, as the Japanese love their pickles. So, I got to thinking...

## Hunger strikes

...well I didn't think very much. In fact, normally I write this part of the story before I make the ramen but I was hungry and fancied a ramen for lunch. So I just made one and then figured, because it tasted so delicious, that I'd write a post about it. I know what you're thinking, do I make ramen and not blog about it? Of course I do, I LOVE RAMEN! I don't always have time to blog about it, but I can always knock up a simple ramen with whatever ingredients I have in the house. Some of best creations have come out this way... but also some of my worst. So, this creation is a hunger-based one, which means it sings very much to my stomach and no one else's. It has strong, pungent flavours that don't just tickle the tastebuds to let you know they are there, they give them a good welly and make their presence known in abundance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

# Sriracha Spiced Chicken Ramen with Pickled Walnuts

## Ingredients (Serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 20g hatcho miso (in 400ml  boiled water)
* 400ml dashi stock

_the tare:_

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sake

_the toppings:_

* 50g frozen sweetcorn
* 2 pickled walnuts, sliced
* 2 spring onions, sliced into rounds
* 1/2 red pepper, sliced thinly
* 1/2 green pepper, sliced thinly
* 1 lg chicken breast, sliced thinly
* 1 tbsp sriracha
* 1/2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 1/2 tbsp fish sauce

_the noodles:_

* 2 packs of soba noodles

## Method

1. Make the broth first by mashing the hatcho miso with some boiled water until is dissolved. Then pour into a sauce pan with the dashi and the rest of the boiled water. Add the soy sauce and the sake. Leave this on a low heat while you make the rest.
2. Add the frozen sweetcorn to the broth and leave to warm through while you make the chicken.
3. Put a little oil in a frying pan and heat up on a high heat. Add the pepper and the chicken and toss in the oil. Fry for a few minutes and then add the fish sauce, when this has boiled off add the sriracha and the vinegar. Keep cooking for a few more minutes until the chicken is cooked, slightly browned and the sauce is a little sticky.
4. Meanwhile add some boiled water to the soba noodles and cook to packet instructions.
5. Add the noodles to the bowl and then top with the chicken and pepper mix, the sweetcorn, the pickled walnuts, the spring onions and then pour over the broth.

Wow! This was a complete surprise! I went with my gut on this one because I was hungry and wanted some ramen. I really wasn't expecting the pickled walnuts to work in a ramen as I assume that malt vinegar is not really very common in Japan (maybe i'm mistaken). Anyway, it worked! The pickle offset the spiciness of the sriracha, which felt a little like having a sorbet in between meals every time I took a bite. I can really see why the Japanese love their pickles now, they cleanse the pallet so that the next bite of ramen feels like your first again! Pickles are one of those common ramen toppings that I knew I would explore at some point but for some reason haven't so far... time to get exploring.

The sriracha chicken was unbelievably flavoursome, I knew it would be when I was making it though. It was a completely spontaneous decision while I was cooking the chicken, which was spurred on by my love of fish sauce. The thought was, I want some balls in this dish and nothing says balls like pongy fish sauce, spicy sriracha and tangy rice vinegar. So I put them together, knowing the flavours would work but unsure of whether they would mingle well with the dashi and miso... but oh they did... oh they did!

To be honest, I could have done without the sweetcorn, but it adds some nice colour to it and it's been a while since I added sweetcorn to a ramen so I figured it was time to do it again. I don't think the flavours of soy sauce and sweetcorn go well together though, I think the best option is to have them with a tonkotsu broth instead, something creamy and fatty to offset the sweetness. I'll have to get some pork bones from the butcher again, but I think I'll wait till after Christmas as this takes some time to cook and I need to work on my Christmas ramen yet!
