# Year of Ramen #05: Mother's Day Chicken and Egg Udon Noodle Soup "Oyakudon"

Hello again and welcome to week 5 of my year exploring the art of ramen. This week is going to be a Mother's Day special because Mothering Sunday is just around the corner. Honestly, I will make and write about a tonkotsu soon, but I'm away all weekend and boiling bones for many hours doesn't seem like a thing I can do on a week night, so it will have to wait till next week.

**The Superbowl**

In Japan there is a wonderful dish called a¬†_donburi_, which is a bowl of rice topped with some yummy ingredients that have been cooked in a small amount of liquid, e.g. soy sauce, mirin and dashi; it's _the_ comfort food that mum's make for their children. I highly recommend trying this dish if you get a chance ([here's a recipe](http://bit.ly/1Y7uwVm)). Anyway, there is a specific donburi known as¬†_oyakodon_, which is a donburi that is topped with both chicken and egg -¬†_oyako_ means parent-and-child and refers to both the chicken and the egg being in the same dish.

This gave me an idea for Mother's Day, why not make a ramen with both parent and child in it... aww how sweet üòç

**Using your noodle**

One thing I haven't talked much about yet is the noodle. You may have noticed that I have been using the same egg noodles in all of my dishes so far. Well, this is because I wasn't ready to start exploring the other types, of which there are many. Instead I was concentrating on the flavourings, broths and toppings. So, today I am going to switch it up a bit and try a different style of noodle, one that I think will compliment the dish better than my usual egg noodle. Before I tell you which noodle I will be using here is some info about the traditional ramen noodles. Ramen noodles are believed to have come from China, in fact the Japanese word _ramen_ is believed to be the Japanese translation of the Chinese words¬†_'la mian'_, which are the¬†Chinese wheat noodles that are made by twisting, stretching and folding the dough into strands - if you've never seen a master noodle maker at work then check out this video to see how it's done,¬†[how to make Chinese noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sfSiWepm7U).

**Udon**

![IMG_4292](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/img_4292.jpg?w=450)

_Udon_ is a thick wheat flour noodle that is made in Japan and can be served in a simple broth known as¬†_kakejiru_, which is basically soy sauce, mirin and dashi; the same ingredients in the oyakodon, funny how that just happened, isn't it? So, I'd like to coin a term for this creation as it's an amalgamation of oyakodon and udon... yep, you've got it... my creation is going to be called _Oyakudon_. You heard it here first, it's bound to be the "next big thing" ü§ó

**Cheap as chicken**

We all know it's cheaper to buy seasonal fruit and vegetables (or at least it used to be) and we all know that buying in bulk is also cheaper, however, buying items from Japan is not cheap. So, to try to alleviate some of the expense I've decided to use the leftovers from a roast chicken - Jamie Oliver would be so proud. Obviously the other main ingredient in this dish is the protein-packed egg. This time I've decided to cook the egg to 64C in the sous-vide for 45 mins, this will mean I have cooked the egg to 63C, 64C and 65C now so it will be good to see which is the better of the three, bearing in mind David Chang recommends the 63C egg (but what does he know, he only runs 21 restaurants in New York, Toronto, Washington DC and Sydney?). To add some crunch and sweetness I'm going to add carrots. Spring onions (or scallions as they are known in the US of A) are a no-brainer on this one, especially as they traditionally go on the udon noodle dish with kakejiru. Finally, as I will be cooking this on Saint David's Day (Dydd Gwyl Dewi), and my wife is Welsh, and I had a spare one in the fridge, I thought I'd add a leek to the mix.

**The circle of life**

So, I've been thinking about presentation and how it can be linked to Mother's Day, after all, part of the enjoyment of ramen is the visual and spiritual aspect of it. So, how do I evoke a feeling of that bond that only a mother and child have? For some reason when I think of that magical union all I hear is Elton John singing "The Circle of Life" so what better way to present my ramen dish than using circles? For this I will need to julienne the carrots very finely, along their length. I could use a mandolin to do this but as I'd rather keep my fingertips so I will use a peeler instead. This will allow me to create fine slices along the length of the carrot that I can then chop into long threads. For the spring onions I will chop off the ends and slice into quarters along the length as well. Cutting both of these finely will allow me to blanch the veg and then swirl around the noodles to make a circle and with the colours being green and orange it should look quite pretty. Finally, the leeks should be finely chopped into circles.

As a slight aside I thought I'd talk to you a little about my lunch habits. I go through many lunch habits as I'm notorious for my faddy diets, although I prefer to think about it as experimentation, which we all know is the best way to success. In the past I've eaten 4000 calories a day so that I could 'bulk up' at the gym and managed to get my weight up to 14.5 stone, which considering my default weight has been 13 stone for a long time, I thought was pretty good. I've also eaten a small meal every two hours, on a cutting diet whilst also keeping the hunger hormone (ghrelin) at bay, but this was pretty taxing on my life as I spent a lot of time preparing food. More recently I've been rocking the 'intermittent fasting' diet, where I would eat only between the hours of 12 noon and 8pm, which has enabled me to lose a stone so¬†my new weight is now 12 stone. One of the main areas of control I have over my diet is what I eat at work, i.e. my lunch; dinner is much more tricky as I have a wife and child and want to have a sit down meal with them, which means I can't do anything too weird (although a year of ramen is already taxing my wife üò¨). I've often thought how nice it would be to have ramen for lunch but I couldn't think of a way to do this without causing HR to have a fit¬†at me bringing my camping stove into the kitchen and ultimately setting fire to something, so I've stuck with the usual sandwiches and sushi that everyone else rocks. Until now...

Yep, you've read that right, Ramen from M&S... just add boiling water! For what is basically a pot-noodle it was surprisingly nice. The noodles are thin enough that with only two minutes "cooking" time in the boiled water, they were soft enough to eat whilst also having a nice bite to them. The soup at first was a bit bland but I realised afterwards that a lot of the flavouring is at the bottom of the pot and after a good stir it livened up the broth - I also found the seaweed, mushrooms and peas at the bottom, so a good stir would have been much more beneficial up front. Ah well, it tasted pretty good so I can't complain, and given it was on a 3 for 2 offer I managed to bag a tasty ramen for lunch, at work, for only ¬£1.17! But don't be fooled by my words of praise... it is by no means a scratch on a freshly cooked homemade ramen, so without further ado.

**Mother's Day Chicken and Egg Udon Noodle Soup "Oyakudon"**

![FullSizeRender](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/fullsizerender.jpg?w=600)

**Ingredients (serves 2)**

_The broth:_

* 1l chicken stock
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tsp instant dashi

_The toppings:_

* 2 eggs, the freshest you can get hold of
* roast chicken
* 4 spring onions, sliced lengthways into quarters
* 1/2 leek, finely sliced into rounds
* 1 lg carrot, thinly sliced lengthways with a peeler and julienned

_The noodles:_

* 2 fresh packets of udon noodles

**Method**

1. If using the sous-vide, heat to 64C and then cook the eggs for 45 minutes. When cooked, plunge the eggs into an ice bath to stop the cooking process and leave for 5 minutes to cool completely.
2. Add all the broth ingredients to a pan and bring to the boil.
3. Add the noodles and cook for 2 minutes until warmed through then split between the bowls.
4. Add the carrots and spring onion to the broth and cook until just soft, then add the veg to the noodles by swirling them round the outside of the bowl, to make a circle.
5. Blanch the leeks in the broth for a minute and then add to the centre of the noodle bowl.
6. Add the chicken to the broth to reheat and then place in the centre of the bowl on the leeks.
7. Slice the egg in two being careful not to lose too much yolk and then place on the chicken.
8. Ladle the broth into the bowl and serve with a smile.

This ramen recipe was delicious, I think it is my best so far! The egg was a little overcooked for my liking so I think David Chang was right when he said 63C is the optimum temperature to cook an egg at. One of the great things about this dish was how quick it was to make, most of the time was in the prep, which means it is a great week night meal, especially using leftover chicken. Until next time...
