# Year of Ramen #04: Simple Seafood Ramen with Ajitsuke Tamago (Soy Marinated Egg)

**My Confession**

This week I have a confession to make, I was supposed to be making the 4th type of ramen broth known asÂ _tonkotsu_, which is a broth made by boiling down pig bones for a very long time until the broth turns a milky white and is delicious (or so I hear). However, I wasn't that well prepared this week as I've been swanning it up in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress finding out about the latest and most awesome tech that is just around the corner, like this cute little fella.

But don't worry dear readers, ramen was still on my mind, especially when I was given the opportunity to create my own Android character...

Unfortunately, when I got home and checked with my butcher as to whether they had some spare pigs trotters knocking around, they told me they had thrown them out already and I would have to wait until next week ðŸ˜žWell, at least you get to look forward to boiled pigs trotters next week ðŸ˜†

**What an egg-cellent idea**

Therefore, for this weeks ramen I decided to take a look at some different toppings that I haven't explored yet. One of the main toppings on ramen is a soft boiled egg, known asÂ _onsen tamago_(for those of you more curious people out there, tamago means egg and is whereÂ the egg-shaped Japanese toy _tamagotchi_ got it's name from - it means egg-friend or egg-watch depending on which source you read).Â Â I've already cooked the onsen tamago in my previous posts so this time I thought I'd try another classic ramen egg calledÂ _ajitsuke tamago_, which is a soy and mirin marinated soft-boiled egg. Marinating the egg in the soy mix turns the white (albumen) a slight brown colour as well as imparting its wonderful flavour. The only thing you have to be careful of is marinating the egg for too long as it can cause the albumen to become rubbery and the yolk to cook and become firm (between 4-12 hours should suffice).

The picture above and the recipe I will be using for the ajitsuke tamago was taken fromÂ http://www.justonecookbook.com/ramen-egg/.

**Seafood, eat it**

I haven't cooked with seafood yet so I'll add some to this ramen, I have some frozen prawns in the freezer so will start with those - can you tell that I have no idea what I'm doing this time? I'm basing a whole ramen around an egg! Ah well, the point of this blog is so that I can understand ramen better and ajitsuke tamago is new to me... this is how I roll.

Don't worry, I've not gone completely mad, I am still living the zen life of a ramen master and making sure I get a good balance of flavours, colours and feelings. I've done this by adding fish sticks, bamboo shoots, carrots and nori to the dish - the nori was something I saw other people adding to their ramen and thought that it looked cool, but was surprised to see it in large squares as this would surely be too much in one mouthful. Anyway, I decided I have to give it a try (plus it's very easy to get from my local Tesco) so here it is.

**Nori**

For those of you that live in a crazy world where sushi doesn't exist, nori is a seaweed that gets mashed up and processed in a similar way to paper so that it forms paper-thin green squares. It is mainly used to wrap sushi but has other uses in Japanese cuisine as well, one of them is evidently in ramen. It is very high in iodine, which is used by the body to make thyroid hormones, which help keep the cells and metabolic rate healthy. So as you can see, it's an all-round good guy in the food stakes, it's basically the food equivalentÂ of Superman.

**Final thoughts**

As I'm doing a fishy dish I want the broth to be simple, an assari broth, which meansÂ _light_. So I have decided to use a simple vegetable stock cube. It will impart a subtle saltiness to the dish but allow the flavours of the toppings to really sing, which is what I want. Here goes...

**SimpleÂ Seafood Ramen with Ajitsuke Tamago (Soy Marinated Egg)**

![IMG_4256](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_4256.jpg?w=290)

**Ingredients (serves 2)**

_The broth:_

* 1l vegetable stock

_The ajitsuke tamago:_

* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp mirin
* 6 tbsp water

_The toppings:_

* 100g frozen tiger prawns
* 4 fish sticks
* 2/3 nori sheet
* menma (canned bamboo shoots), drained
* 1 carrot, chopped into thin rounds

_The noodles:_

* 2 medium egg noodle slabs

**Method**

1. To make the ajitsuke tamago you need to bring a pan of water to the boil and then turn the heat down to a simmer, add the eggs and allow to cook gently for 6 minutes. Do not let the pan boil as this can cause the eggs to split and also overcook the eggs.
2. When cooked, gently place the eggs, using a slotted spoon, into a bath of iced water and leave to cool down for 5 minutes. When cool, peel gently, as the egg should not be fully set, and place into a ziplock bag.
3. Pour the soy sauce, mirin and water into the bag, remove the air using a bath of water and seal the bag. Place in the fridge to marinate for at least four hours or up to 12\. I marinated mine for 8 hours.
4. Boil the carrots for roughly 7 minutes.
5. Bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a pan and then add the frozen prawns.
6. Cook the noodles in boiling water until they are soft but still a little chewy. Then divide between 2 bowls.
7. Take the eggs out of the marinade and slice in two, being careful not to spill too much of the runny yolk. Place on the noodles with the yolk facing up.
8. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl, presenting them nicely.
9. Finally, wedge the nori sheets around the edges.
10. Serve with soy sauce, nanami togarashi and love.

Ok, so how did this attempt at a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants ramen go ðŸ¤”Well, it depends who you ask. I thought it was pretty good but it did lack a bit of balance. My wife, well, what can I say, she made herself a bolognese! I blame it on the fact that she has recently been ill though and although ramen is my comfort food, she is Italian at heart. I stand by my ramen.

Anyway, I'm sure you are all dying to know how my egg turned out?! Well, it turns out this is trickier than first anticipated and it takes more than just an egg, some soy sauce and mirin. I ended up cooking my first eggs from room temperature for 6 minutes beforeÂ cooling but when I came to peeling them, the egg was not playing ball. The shell would not break off nicely and the egg was too soft soÂ I ended up splitting all the eggs! I managed to get one into the marinade (shown below) but the other went into the bin.

Not exactly the look I was going for! I put this down to the eggs being pretty old so I went straight down to the farmers market, which luckily happened to be on, and bought some eggs that were laid only 2 days ago, these worked much better but were still difficult to do as they were far too soft and meant as soon as I cut into them the yolk went everywhere. So my first attempt at ajitsuke tamago didn't go too well but I will definitely be trying these again as the flavour was delicious!
