# Year of Ramen #09: Sapporo Ramen

## The birthplace of the miso ramen

Sapporo holds the title of inventing the miso ramen (remember there are 4 flavour types of ramen: salt, soy, miso and tonkotsu - although the latter is more of a broth than a flavouring). The story goes that in 1955, a customer at the Aji No Sanpei restaurant asked for some noodles to be added to his miso and pork soup and suddenly, history was made. It shot to fame after that, because after the war people wanted healthy food that was nutritional but also cheap to produce, Miso is made by fermenting soybeans with salt and a type of fungus and thus has better nutritional properties than just salt or soy sauce alone, it was also inexpensive.

Since it's creation many restaurants around Sapporo have taken this recipe and made it their own, and now the ramen has evolved into a rich and fatty soup. One thing that has remained is the way in which the ramen is prepared, the pork mince and vegetables are cooked in a wok with the miso and the broth before being added to the noodles. I will be attempting to recreate the original Sapporo ramen for this post as I want to see what was so special about it that it changed a nation. I'll save the rich and fatty version for another day.

## You butter believe it

One of the common toppings to a Sapporo ramen is a knob of butter that can be stirred into the broth, to add both body and depth to the dish. This is not what I expected to be adding to a ramen if I'm honest, but I can see the appeal as it would help to add a creaminess to the dish, temper some of the salt in the miso and satiate a hungry Northern Japanese person on a cold winters day. It kind of reminds me of how in Britain Southerners like their chips dry whilst their Northern counterparts like their chips smothered in gravy or curry sauce. As I'm from the North I think I'll get on just fine with butter on my ramen! But the link to the UK doesn't stop at butter. What wonderful ingredient, when doused in butter, on a warm summers day in the UK, is eaten with a BBQ? You got it... sweetcorn! Yes that's right, sweetcorn is a common ingredient that gets added to a miso-based ramen and this coupled with the butter will add a deliciousness that is on another level. Ooh I'm excited just thinking about it.

## Miso hungry

I've used miso in one of my posts before but I've not really explained anything about what it is. Above I've explained that it is fermented soybeans but there is so much more to it than just that. Depending on how long it is fermented for, and also what other ingredients are included in the fermentation, there can be quite a few different varieties with drastically different flavours. They range from the mild shiro (white) miso through to the very dark hatcho miso and are used in different ways depending on their type.

So what are the differences?

### Shiro Miso

Shiro miso is a mild miso paste that is pale in colour, bordering on white, and is used in soups, such as [miso and tofu soup](http://minimalistbaker.com/15-minute-miso-soup-with-greens-and-tofu/), dressings, marinades and sauces - it is very versatile and well worth having in your cupboard compared to the othe miso pastes. Shiro miso is fermented for only a short while, so it is less salty and sweeter than the rest.

### Shinshu Miso

Shinshu miso is another mild miso paste but this one is slightly darker in colour than shiro and is known as "yellow" miso because of this. It is fermented more than shiro, which gives it a slightly deeper level of flavour. It is generally used in soups and glazes, such as [miso glazed seabass](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/miso-glazed-sea-bass-102851).

### Aka Miso

Aka miso is much darker than the previous two miso pastes and is commonly known as "red" miso because of this. It is fermented for even longer and therefore is much saltier and has a far greater depth of flavour than the other two. As aka miso is a stronger miso it tends to be used sparingly in light dishes, as it can easily over power them, or is reserved for hearty dishes that require greater flavour, such as [red miso soup](http://norecipes.com/red-miso-soup).

### Awase Miso

Awase miso is the combination of two different types of miso paste, commonly you will see a shiro miso combined with an aka miso to bring in some of the flavour profiles of both. It's great if you don't want to have a long list of miso pastes stored in your fridge as you can play around with the mixtures to change the saltiness easily. The recipe in this post will use an awase miso made from a shiro miso and a genmai miso.

### Genmai Miso

Genmai miso is made from the fermentation of brown rice as well as soybeans and because the starches in the rice are quickly converted into sugars, it has a short fermentation period and is slightly sweet in taste.

### Hatcho Miso

Hatcho miso is an all-soybean fermented paste that has a brown colour to it, it is the darkest of all the misos and is fermented for between 2-3 years, which gives it a deep, rich flavour. It has the highest protein content and highest fat content of all the misos, which makes it particularly good for winter cooking. Use sparingly and mix with other lighter misos.

### Mugi Miso

Mugi miso is made from the fermentation of barley as well as soybeans and this makes it not too sweet and not overpowering. It is known in Japan colloquially as "country style" miso and can be used in both summer and winter.

There are many other miso types, such as komugi miso, Saikyo miso and moromi miso, but I won't go into them all as they become regional specialities and very difficult to get hold of in the UK. For the time being, the list above will give you enough information to get started using this wonderful ingredient.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_The broth:_

* 1cm piece of ginger, minced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1l pork stock
* 1 tbsp genmai miso
* 1 tbsp shiro miso

_The toppings:_

* 250g pork mince
* 2 knobs of butter
* 100g sweetcorn
* 2/3 sheet of nori, cut into rectangles
* 1/2 can of bamboo shoots, drained
* 4 spring onions, sliced and separated into white and green parts
* 150g beansprouts
* chilli flakes (optional)
* sesame oil

_The noodles:_

* 2 blocks of ramen noodles

## Method

1. Gently fry the ginger and garlic in sesame oil for a minute.
2. Add the pork and white parts of the spring onions and fry until just browning.
3. Dissolve both miso pastes in some hot water using a fork and then add to the pan and mash into the pork until fragrant.
4. Add the bamboo shoots and stock to the pan and bring to a gentle simmer.
5. Cook the noodles in water and then divide between two bowls.
6. One minute before the noodles are ready add the sweetcorn and the beansprouts to the stock.
7. Pour the broth over the noodles, dividing the meat and vegetables between the bowls.
8. Sprinkle the green spring onions over the noodles.
9. Sprinkle the chilli flakes over the noodles.
10. Add the nori to one side of the bowl.
11. Add a knob of butter to each bowl.

This was an interesting dish but not something I would say blew my mind. I was expecting a deeper level of flavour than I got and I think this was down to using the genmai miso, I might have to try this again sometime using a blend of hatcho miso and shiro miso to see if that is key. Don't get me wrong, there was still a lovely flavour to the dish and the butter and sweetcorn worked perfectly in adding creaminess, but I felt as though there was something missing. The addition of the chilli flakes is a must if you ask me but this may be because the soup lacked flavour.

One thing I was disappointed about was how the dish was presented. When the vegetables are all cooked with the broth it makes it difficult to present the dish in an appealing way. I tried to counterbalance this by adding some nori, spring onions, butter and chilli flakes but it didn't quite resonate with me. Still, it looked better than the one from Aji No Sanpei, so I feel I did it justice. I will come back to a Sapporo ramen one day but I'll definitely update the recipe to the more modern variety that is rich and fatty and see how that goes.
