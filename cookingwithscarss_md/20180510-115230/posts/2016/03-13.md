# Year of Ramen #06: First-Aid Chicken Soup Ramen

There seems to have been a bit of an epidemic of the flu going around the North-West of the UK these past few weeks. There have been people walking around the officeÂ looking like they are trying out for a part on The Walking Dead, my wife has turned into Darth Vader and Kleenex profits have risen more than when Britney Spears first released Hit Me Baby One More Time. The only person that doesn't seem to have been affected is my 2 year old daughter, which is surprising considering she spends most of her days rubbing faces with other toddlers!Â So with all this illness going around it's a good time do a healthy chicken soup styled ramen.

**Why is chicken soup healthy?**

Chicken soup is one of those recipes that every culture has a version of and every mother has cooked for their child to make them feel better. In America they have chicken and noodle soup, in Vietnam they have pho ga, and in Britain we have simple chicken soup. So, why is this humble dish considered by many cultures to be the go-to dish when people are feeling under the weather? A [study](http://nyti.ms/1kr44pO) done by Dr. Stephen Rennard in 2000 showed that drinking chicken soup inhibits the movement of neutrophils, which are white blood cells that defend against infection. When someone gets a cold these white blood cells migrate to the upper respiratory tract and cause the cold symptoms. Therefore, by drinking chicken soup you can inhibit this movement, thus helping reduce upper respiratory Â cold symptoms. Awesome!

**Super foods**

A warming bowl of chicken soup may feel comforting to an ill person and it may even help with reducing cold symptoms but to make someone truly feel well again it needs to include some super foods that are full of good nutrients. We already know this dish will include chicken and noodles so let's throw in some superhero foods to really blast this cold into smithereens.

Ginger is good for us but exactly what is so good about it? For one it is great at relieving nausea, so there are a lot of women out there who swear by a cup of ginger tea to relieve morning sickness when they are pregnant. It can also soothe the digestive system by eliminating excessive gas (so maybe we should serve gingerbread after Christmas dinner instead of the usual Christmas pud ðŸ˜‚). It also helps to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and improves mobility. However, the main benefit to drinking ginger is that it warms you up from the inside and promotes perspiration, which is great for helping to beat a cold that is coming on.

_[Garlic](http://bit.ly/1pnp5X6)_

Recently garlic has been researched for links with reducing heart disease, cholesterol and cancer because it makes the platelets in the body less likely to clump together and stick to artery walls. However, garlic has a long history of fighting infections, against viruses, bacteria and fungi. During World War II garlic was referred to as 'Russian penicillin' because when the Russians ran out of antibiotics they turned to garlic to treat their wounded soldiers. What better ingredient to help against the war on Man-Flu!

**Simple yet complex**

For the rest of the toppings I wanted to add some carrots, mushrooms, nori and leek, for no reason other than to add some depth to the dish and get more colours in. However, this left me with a problem. Usually ramen is presented with the toppings on top, hence the reason they are called toppings. However, sometimes, when there are lots of toppings, the dish can start to look a little too complex, and when you are serving a dish to someone who is not feeling too well you may find they are automatically turned off by the prospect of a complex dish. Therefore, for this ramen I've moved the toppings to the bottom of the dish, except for just one ingredient, the leek, so that the dish looks simple and easy to eat, even for someone who is not in the mood for food.

**Ingredients (Serves 1)**

_The broth:_

* _500ml chicken stock_
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tbsp mirin
* 1/2 clove garlic, minced
* 0.5cm piece ginger, minced

_The toppings:_

* handful left-over chicken thigh, sliced
* 1/3rd sheet nori, sliced thinly
* 1/2 carrot, sliced thinly with a peeler
* 1/3 leek, sliced thinly
* 3 chestnut mushrooms, sliced
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil

_The noodles:_

* 1 block of egg noodle

**Method**

1. Put all the broth ingredients in a pan and bring to a simmer
2. Fry the mushrooms in the sesame oil
3. Add the carrots to the broth and cook for 1 minute
4. Cook the noodles
5. When the carrots have been in for one minute, add the chicken to the broth and cook until warmed through
6. Place the mushrooms, chicken, carrot and nori in a bowl
7. When the noodles are cooked add them to the bowl
8. Blanch the leeks in the broth for 1 minute and then add to the centre of the noodles
9. Pour over the broth and deliver to your unwell loved one with some green tea

The flavour of this dish isÂ relatively mild, which is probably what you want if you are feeling unwell, but the spices introduce a deeper warmth to the body and reawaken the senses that are deadened when under the influence of influenza. So if you have a loved one out there that is battling hard against infections why not whip them up a bowl of first-aid chicken soup ramen to show them that you care, and to get them feeling all warm and fuzzy again.
