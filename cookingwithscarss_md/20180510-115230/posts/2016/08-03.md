# Year of Ramen #15: Tonkotsu Ramen with Seared Sesame Tuna

## The holy grail

So, I've finally got round to getting some pork bones and trotters from the butchers so that I can make a tonkotsu ramen, supposedly the holy grail of the ramen world. I've never tasted tonkotsu so attempting to create an authentic experience is going to be tricky, especially considering it is one of the most involved ramen recipes. The bones have to first be blanched of all their blood and then they have to be cleaned before evenÂ starting the cooking process. Then during the cooking any scum that rises to the top needs to be removed and to top it all off, the whole boiling process should last for at least 6 hours (but some restaurants seem to cook it for days on end). All of this hard work and preparation should lead to a wonderfully satisfying, milky white broth that sticks to your lips as you slurp it through the noodles. I can hardly contain my excitement for this one!

## Under pressure

![20160801_153940](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/20160801_153940.jpg?w=600)To cook in the pressure cooker or not to, that is the question. Pressure cookers are a great invention to speed up the time it takes for the collagen in meats to break down and render the meat so tender it seems to literally melt in your mouth. For this reason it is a great way to create a bolognese sauce during the week as it allows the meat to be cooked for around an hour instead of three of four. It is also a great way to create a stock because the pressure cooker allows for temperatures of up to 120C to be reached, which means the collagen can be converted into gelatin much quicker giving a greater body to the stock. This sounds like the exact thing we want in a tonkotsu, a nice thick body. So, for this recipe I will try pressure cooking the bones. Next time I will try the 6 hour method though as I'm all about the experiments.

## Tuna?

Ok, so you may think I've gone a bit mad by adding tuna to a pork broth but hear me out. I had tuna in the fridge and it needed to be eaten so I figured, why not give it a go I may just stumble upon an unknown and delicious flavour combination in the process? My next port of call was to figure out what would go with this interesting medley. I knew I would need something that would cut through the fattiness of the tonkotsu broth so I decided that raw cucumber would be perfect as it goes so well with tuna. Also, an egg... well, it goes in a tuna niÃ§oise so it's in. A little more colour is needed so I'm going to also add boiled carrots which will keep the flavour clean. Finally, because I've added tuna, which adds a fishiness to the dish, I want to improve on that with some nori sheets. This really is going to be a Frankenstein ramen in the making. Oh well, wish me luck!

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 1kg pork bones
* 2 pigs trotters, split lengthways
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 2 celery sticks, diced
* 6 garlic cloves, bashed
* 15 black peppercorns

_the tare:_

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sake

_the toppings:_

* 2 tuna steaks
* 2 tbsp sesame seeds
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lg carrot, sliced into rounds
* 1 lg egg
* 1/4 cucumber, sliced into rounds
* 1/2 sheet nori, cut into slices

_the noodles:_

* 2 blocks of medium egg noodles

## Method

_the broth:_

1. Add the bones and trotters to a pressure cooker pan, fill with cold water and then bring to the boil. Boil for a few minutes and then pour all the water away. Wash the bones and trotters in cold water to remove as much of the blood as possible. The cleaner you can get the bones the better the end result will be.
2. Clean the pan and re-add the bones and trotters and add cold water to cover the bones again. Bring back to the boil and skim off the scum that rises to the surface for 30 mins.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and then place the lid on top and pressure cook for 2 hours.

the ramen:

1. Pre-heat the sous-vide to 43C and then vacuum seal the tuna steaks and cook for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place the egg in a pan and pour cold water so it completely covers the egg. Then bring up to the boil and take off the heat and leave for 10 minutes. After this time pour the hot water away and carefully peel the egg shell under cold running water. Slice the egg in two to add to the ramen at the end.
3. Slice the carrots into rounds and then boil for 5 minutes until, just al dente. You want a bit of crunch but not too much. Drain and set aside until ready to plate up.
4. Add the sesame seeds to a pan and cook until nicely browned. You'll need to keep stirring to make sure they don't burn. When done, pour onto a plate.
5. Take 1l of the pork stock and pour it into a clean saucepan, add the tare to it and heat until hot.
6. Cook the noodles in boiling water until soft and then drain and split between the bowls.
7. Heat some oil in a pan until smoking then take the tuna out of the sous-vide and dab with some kitchen roll before briefly frying on both sides to brown. Take out of the pan and place on the sesame seeds to cover, then slice into lengths and display on the noodles.
8. Slice the cucumber into rounds and then add to the dish with the carrot and nori.
9. Carefully pour in the broth and then finish the dish off with half of the egg.

This was a strange dish and one that I was reluctant to post about as it was pretty bad. I was so excited to finally give the tonkotsu broth a try but unfortunately it turned out to be unbelievably fatty and this left a pretty bad taste in my mouth as well as my stomach. In fact, I felt very much like the very hungry caterpillar after he'd eaten through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. So much so that I felt I had stomach ache and needed a green leaf to make me feel better!

The broth had a nice taste to it initially and as it was so fatty and thick it stuck to the noodles really well, but unfortunately the honeymoon period ended quickly with this dish. What surprises me the most is that tonkotsu should not only have pigs trotters in the broth but should also have minced pork fatback as well, it seems like the most unhealthy meal that could ever be invented. Before I started this ramen I wanted to create a tonkotsu broth in the pressure cooker and one that was on a rolling boil for 6 hours and see if I could taste the difference but now I'm not sure I want to do another one! What am I saying... of course I will attempt it again, I bloody loves ramen! I have a few improvements for next time already lined up. I couldn't get pork leg bones this time so had to make do with ribs, which I've read is not the best ingredient, I've also heard that the addition of chicken wings is supposed to impart a delicious flavour to the broth as well; and finally, I will adjust the bone-water ratio next time as the broth was incredibly thick and I think that was too much.

I'm sure you are all wondering how well the toppings went... well, they weren't the best. I think when it comes to tonkotsu, the more pork the better. Tuna and pork are not a match made in heaven. Lesson learned!
