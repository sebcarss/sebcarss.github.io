# Year of Ramen #14: Smoked Aubergine and Pulled Pork Ramen in an Umami-Rich Vegetable Broth

## The makings of a good stock

I've always been someone who follows recipes when it comes to making a stock, I guess this comes from the fact I was initially a commis chef and was given recipes to create exactly as they were written. I've found my own skills since those days though and figure at the ripe old age of 31 that it's time to start making my own stock. But can I just through any old veg into a pan and boil it down to make a stock? No, not really. There are some veg that are made for stocks, such as onions and celery, and others, such as cabbage, that are very strongly flavoured and shouldn't go anywhere near a stock pot unless you are being very adventurous, which I'm not.

Making a vegetable stock that is flavoursome requires the right balance of ingredients and the appropriate amount of time cooking above a specific heat. Here are some rules to follow when cooking a vegetable stock that will help you to maximise the flavour:

**Chop vegetables finely**

Some recipes suggest you throw your veg in cut however you like but the problem with this method is you end up having a small surface area between the vegetable and the water, ideally you want as much surface area as possible so that more flavour can be released quickly. For this it is best to chop your vegetables finely.

**Some vegetables should be browned**

There are some vegetables, such as onions, carrots, garlic, celery, etc., that should be browned first. This is because these vegetables release their sweet juices during this browning and this is what caramelises and imparts a deeper flavour to the broth. You don't have to follow this step but browning these ingredients for 10 minutes prior to adding the water makes a big difference.

**Use cold water**

Different vegetables release their flavours at different temperatures so one rule to follow when making a vegetable stock is to start with cold water and bring the water up to the boil, this will allow all the flavours to appear at the right time in the broth.

**Simmer, don't boil**

Some vegetables don't boil well and boiling these will mean you lose some of the wonderful flavour. However, if you don't bring the temperature above 84C then you won't extract the flavour from other vegetables such as carrots. So you need a gentle simmer to extract the goodness from all your veg without it spoiling.

So, now we know the basics of cooking a good stock it's time to choose our vegetables. But before we do that I want to take you on a little adventure into what makes food taste so good. Bear with me, it will be worth it ðŸ˜€

## Chinese Restaurant Syndrome

Back in 1986 a man figured out that whenever he went to a Chinese restaurant, 15 minutes after the first dish, he would start to get symptoms of health problems, such as numbness and palpitations. After discovering this he wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine explaining his problem and the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome was created. Since then many people have attributed these side effects to an ingredient known as MSG (mono-sodium glutamate) and in doing so have caused many ignorant people to turn their nose up at anything that contained the substance, even though no scientific study has ever found MSG to be bad for people. In fact MSG is found in many types of natural food and adds an umami taste thatÂ enhances the savoury flavour. Items such as potatoes, tomatoes and mushrooms all contain MSG and so does the wonderful parmesan cheese. These items are eaten regularly and there are no side effects from the MSG so ignore all the daft comments and enjoy the full flavour life has to offer!

## What is umami?

![Evernote Camera Roll 20160224 165821](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/evernote-camera-roll-20160224-165821.jpg?w=600)We all know about the wonderful tastes of salty, sour, sweet and bitter, by combining these ingredients we can make a dish well balanced and delicious. Back in 1908, a guy called Kikunae Ikeda figured out that there was another taste, a fifth taste, that didn't fit with any of the known four, a rich meaty flavour that was found in certain foods, such as red meat, cheese and tomatoes (of course being Japanese he discovered it with ingredients such as bonito fish flakes, shiitake mushrooms and fermented bean paste). He called this new taste _umami,_ which roughly translated means "pleasant savoury taste"_,Â _and in my opinion it is the best taste of them all, which is probably one the reasons I like ramen so much.Â I'm the kind of guy that orders cheese after a meal instead of cake, prefers a starter and a main over a main and a dessert, and would rather have a bacon and egg butty in the morning instead of a pain au chocolat.

## Breakfasts Around the World

Ok so I'm tangenting again, I love a good tangent, but don't worry I will come back to the ramen shortly. Have patience young grasshopper. So, all this talk of umami has made me think about how different cultures around the world celebrate breakfast, and yes I said celebrate, breakfast is a beautiful time of the day! It's a time when we get to eat our first meal, the time when our body is really prepared for it, like when you've been for a long hike and you get to a pub and they bring a large steak and kidney pie with chips and a fine ale; at breakfast your body is crying out for a taste sensation to set you up for the day and give you that wonderful spring in your step!

<div>Let's take a look at some breakfasts. So, firstly we have the UK and the fried breakfast, a breakfast who's only health benefit is the satisfaction it brings to the mind (sorry body, you get the rough end of this particular stick); and where does this feeling come from... umami! Next up we'll move to the EU and pick Spain with their highly energetic breakfast of sugary treats, such as, chocolate covered donuts, and very strong black coffee. Whoever thought up this breakfast needs to take a long hard look at themselves, I mean, seriously, how can you eat that much sugar first thing and then concentrate? I guess that's one of the reasons they are known to say "manyana" all the time! Finally, I'll move on to my personal favourite, Vietnam, with its unbelievably, mouth-watering taste explosion that is _pho_Â - the beef noodle soup that is heavily flavoured with an umami rich beef broth, pungent fish sauce, and aromatic herbs (Vietnamese mint, basil and coriander). As you may imagine, my wife is not too pleased when I make this for breakfast, it's not quite as nice being woken up to the smell of fish sauce cooking as it is to bacon under the grill!</div>

## Vegetable Stock

<div>See, wasn't that worth diverting from the stock? You now have a better understanding of why the stock is so important in the ramen process and why food tastes so delicious. So getting back to my stock, I will be adding tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms to add a greater depth of umami flavour to the dish. I've never added tomatoes to a stock before so it will be an interesting experiment. A stalwart in the stock department is the humble onion so I will also add this along with it's good buddies the carrot and celery (these three humble ingredients make up the great French base known asÂ _mirepoix_). To make it more Asian I figured some garlic and ginger wouldn't go amiss and finely some black peppercorns to give it a little kick. Ooh I'm excited about this stock!</div>

## Whatever's in the fridge

One of the great things about enjoying cooking is being able to open the fridge, find some random ingredients and put them together to make something wonderful. My wife will attest to the fact that I'm not usually the best at this, I like to plan my food and then go to the shops to get the ingredients. However, today is different, today I have found an ingredient in the fridge that I love and I want to make it work on a ramen. And that ingredient is the aubergine.

The aubergine is one of my favourite vegetables. If you have never tried a baba ganoush or a miso and honey marinated aubergine then you really are missing out, hunt it down and eat it, you won't be disappointed! Anyway, there are only two ways that I can think of to cook aubergine for a ramen, the first would be to slice it, marinate it and grill it; and the second would be to dice it and fry it in a similar way to a baba ganoush, which would give it a creaminess. I decided for the latter as some recipes I have seen for ramen add pastes to the top so this would work in a similar way, but added some paprika and chilli to give it a bit of punch too. So here goes.

* Smoked aubergine (see below)
* 2 spring onions, sliced
* Chilli flakes (optional)

_The smoked aubergine:_

* 1tbsp olive oil
* 2 babyÂ aubergines, minced
* 1 red onion, minced
* 1 tomato, minced
* 1 birds eye chilli, minced
* 1tsp smoked paprika
* pinch of salt

_The noodles:_

* 2 packs of egg noodles
* 1tbsp sesame oil

## Method

1. _For the stock:Â _Add the oil to a saucepan and turn up to a medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot and garlic and fry gently for 10 minutes until just browning. Pour in the cold water, shiitake mushrooms, ginger, black peppercorns and tomatoes, place a lid on the pan and bring up to the boil (but don't boil). Then simmer for 30 minutes with the lid on. When done, sieve the solids and discard saving the stock. Put the stock back in the pan and add the soy sauce, sake and mirin. Keep warm whilst you make the rest of the dish.![20160621_144202](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160621_144202.jpg?w=600)
2. _For the smoked aubergine:Â _Heat the oil in a pan, add the aubergine and onion and cook on low for 35 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Add the tomatoes and chilli and continue cooking for 25 minutes. Now add the smoked paprika and cook for 10 minutes more.Â ![20160621_144046](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160621_144046.jpg?w=600)
3. _For the ramen:Â _Cook the noodles for around 4 minutes, until just cooked and then drain well and toss in the sesame oil before adding to the bowls. Place the smoked aubergine mix on the noodles, followed by the pork and finally the spring onions. Sprinkle over chilli flakes if desired. Serve with a bowl of stock.

Oh my word, that was amazing!! I have never tried a vegetable stock that packed that much punch! Adding the tomatoes and the mushrooms was a great idea, it really lifted the stock and gave the whole dish a well rounded flavour. I can really see why the stock is of great importance when cooking a ramen now, if I had've used a stock cube this dish would have been watery and limp but instead it was alive and tickling all my tastebuds!

The smoky aubergine paste gave the dish a creamy feel and combined with the stock made the soup much thicker, which ultimately was delicious. It had the perfect amount of heat to just tingle the tongue without burning it and was balanced beautifully with the mirin in the broth.

I was partly expecting the broth to be tasted separately to cleanse the palate after the intenseness of the pork and aubergine in the noodles but after tasting the two together I realised that combining them into a more traditional ramen was literally perfect. It still looks nice to serve themÂ separately but ultimately it is not necessary, I'll save that for another day when I do tsukemen (dipping noodles).
