# Year of Ramen #22: Meatball Ramen with Hatcho Miso and Crispy Nori

## Cow pat, anyone?

A while back I went to my favourite store in Liverpool to get some miso ([http://www.mattas.co.uk/](http://www.mattas.co.uk/)) and while there I came across some varieties that I had never heard of. One of these was genmai miso, which I have talked about in another post [Year of Ramen #09: Sapporo Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/year-of-ramen-09-sapporo-ramen/), and the other was hatcho miso, which I also talked about in that post... here is what I said:

> Hatcho miso is an all-soybean fermented paste that has a brown colour to it, it is the darkest of all the misos and is fermented for between 2-3 years, which gives it a deep, rich flavour. It has the highest protein content and highest fat content of all the misos, which makes it particularly good for winter cooking. Use sparingly and mix with other lighter misos.

So for this ramen I have decided to give this miso a spin and see if I can unlock it's deliciousness. On first glance though, it doesn't look particularly appealing...

Anyone would think I've just been to the local field and popped a cow pat in a tub to take home. Not pretty but tasty I'm sure. I don't have any light misos on me today so I'm going to dive right in and use it on its own. Let's see if this works.

## Nori crisps!!

I've recently bought a new ramen book called [Simply Ramen by Amy Kimoto-Kahn](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Simply-Ramen-Complete-Course-Preparing-ebook/dp/B01BVGSSN2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481822059&sr=1-1&keywords=simply+ramen), which has a recipe for roasted nori. These are nori sheets that are brushed with oil and then lightly fanned over an open flame to crisp up, and finally some salt is tossed over them to add some additional flavour. I figured these have to be tried so I'm adding these to my dish as well. Hope they work as well as they sound.

# Meatball Ramen with Hatcho Miso and Crispy Nori

## Ingredients (Serves 1)

_the broth:_

* 10g hatcho miso
* 3g instant dashi powder

_the tare:_

* 1.5 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sake

_the toppings:_

* 7 meatballs (see [Year of Ramen #21: “Spaghetti” and Meatballs Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/12/15/year-of-ramen-21-spaghetti-and-meatballs-ramen/))
* 3 sheets of nori
* 1/3 red pepper sliced thinly
* spring onions, sliced into rounds

_the noodles:_

* 1 slab of medium egg noodles

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 180C and then put the meatballs in for 15 minutes.
2. To make the broth add the hatcho miso and a small amount of boiled water to a jug and smash it together with a fork until dissolved, it will not dissolve on its own so requires a bit of mashing. Pour this into a pan with about 400ml boiled water and the dashi powder.
3. Meanwhile heat your bowl in another oven if you can... so your ramen stays nice and hot for these winter months.
4. Add the pepper to the broth and keep on a low heat - you don't want to boil off the lovely nutrients in the miso.
5. For the crispy nori take each sheet and spray or brush lightly with oil and then using tongs fan the nori over a gas hob till crisp.
6. Put the noodles into boiling water and cook until soft, around 3-4 minutes. Drain.
7. When everything is ready take the bowls out of the oven and put the tare mix into the bottom of the bowl. Top with the noodles, then red pepper, then meatballs, then spring onions and place the crispy nori on the side.
8. Enjoy this wonderful, personal treat however you like it.

This was a delight! A deliciously clean taste with a great savoury hit and an umami-rich ball of meat to top it off. The hatcho miso was the star of the show for me as I'd not tried it before. I tasted a bit before it went in and the overall taste was of a strong salty variety but that is to be expected. However, when diluted with hot water and combined with the wonderful umami flavours in a dashi stock the miso was given a sumptuous lift that left my taste buds tingling but not overwhelmed.

The meatballs were a good addition but I don't think they are the best meatballs for ramen, I used them because I have a tonne of them left over from my previous ramen but they could be better. They seem to detract from the overall flavour and feel like a separate item on the plate instead of being part of the ramen family.

The crispy nori was an utter delight though. If you've ever tried sushi you'll know what the flavour of nori is like but if you are anything like me you will try everything on its own first before trying it with other items. So, when I had a pack of nori i took a bite out of the nori on its own and, although not bad, it really works better when combined with other ingredients - it's rather limp on its own. However, when you lightly fry the nori so that it becomes more like a crisp it takes on a new lease of life and stands up for itself in the battle to woo your tastebuds. I highly recommend this as a way to get some high quality iodine into you as it's damn tasty and very easy to do. I'm guessing you have figured this out by now but I forgot to toss salt over the nori... what a dingbat! I guess I'll just have to do this again with salt... mmm!
