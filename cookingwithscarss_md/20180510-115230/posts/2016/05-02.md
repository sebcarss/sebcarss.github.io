# Year of Ramen #12: My "Pot Noodle" Ramen for Work

One of my favourite chefs is a fella named Heston Blumenthal. He takes something so dear to my <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">heart</span> stomach and makes it better by adding a scientific element to it, which makes him a proper food geek... and who doesn't love a food geek? One thing that I love about him is the fact he has a portable induction hob that fits in a suitcase. This is not a difficult achievement, of course, you just have to have enough money to buy a portable induction hob, which cost around [Â£30](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B017WBRY7G?psc=1)...hang on... Â£30!! No way! Why do I only find this out now? Looks like a new toy is on the cards ðŸ˜ŠÂ Anyway, Heston has cool toys, I like cool toys, the world is full of cool toys... it really is a great time to be alive. But the reason why I like this particular toy is it's portable, has no fire risk and would allow me to cook a ramen wherever, including at work. As you may have guessed though, I don't have an induction hob but that's not going to stop me getting a nutritious and delicious ramen in me at lunch now is it?

This week I will be attempting to make my very own lunchbox ramen, which you may refer to as a glorified Pot Noodle, of which you would be partially correct. To get the results that I am looking for without the aid of a live flame or induction hob, I'm going to have to use the heat from the kettle only. This poses a few issues, first and foremost, how do I cook noodles without a constant heat; and secondly, what ingredients can I use that don't require any actual cooking?

## I'll have a skinny ramen, please

There are many types of ramen noodles, the ones that people in the UK are most used to are the wavy, dried noodles that you get with either a Pot Noodle or a Supernoodles packet. These have been partially cooked and then deep fried to dry them out and shape them as required. This means they require rehydrating to bring them back to life. As you most likely already know from the Pot Noodle, adding boiling water and leaving for a specified amount of time will rehydrate them enough that they can be an (arguably) delicious snack. Therefore, to recreate this in work I will need thin enough noodles that they can be rehydrated enough using just boiled water. For this I have decided to go for extra-fine egg noodles. I could have chosen vermicelli noodles but I didn't feel that these would give the feel of a proper ramen so decided against them.

## No-cook toppings

There are plenty of toppings in the world of ramen that do not need cooking and just get added to the top cold. I could go down this route and add things like nori, crab sticks, narutomaki, spring onions and pickles; but I want to try something a little more interesting so have decided to add chashu pork, sweetcorn, spinach and a soft boiled egg.

Obviously I couldn't make the chashu at work so I have taken a few slices from a previously prepared incarnation that was stored in the freezer. This is perfect for work because I can take it out of the freezer in the morning, place it in a box with the frozen sweetcorn, sliced spinach and the soft boiled egg; and it will keep the ingredients cold enough while it is defrosting and thus not require refrigeration.

## No induction hob required

So, I don't need an induction hob to make this but I do need one piece of special equipment and that is a cafetiere. I'm sure this can be done in something else but a cafetiere works perfectly as it comes with a lid and an in-built sieve, and is made for boiled water.

The basic principle to this dish is to build your noodle dish in a pot and add boiled water. It is just a Pot Noodle that is home made and not mass produced, but what a difference this will make to your life. It has fresh ingredients, is more nutritious, is more filling and is a real pleasure to eat whilst still being as simple and easy to make as the classic alternative; plus you can throwÂ in a load of different ingredients (as long as they are already cooked).

# My "Pot Noodle"Â Ramen for Work

## Ingredients (serves 1)

_The broth:_

* 1/2 pork stock cube
* 1/2 tbsp genmai miso
* 1 tsp soy sauce

_The toppings:_

* 1 soft boiled egg
* 25g frozen sweetcorn
* 3 slices of chashu (see:Â [Year of Ramen #10: Chashu Pork and Egg Ramen with a Salt Broth](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/year-of-ramen-10-chashu-pork-and-egg-ramen-with-a-salt-broth/))
* small handful of spinach

_The noodles:_

* 1 bundle of extra-fine egg noodles

## Method

1. Place the noodles in the cafetiere and fill with boiled water, put the lid of and leave for 3 minutes before stirring the noodles and pouring away the water.
2. Place the broth ingredients into the cafetiere, along with the sweetcorn, chashu, and spinach. Stir the broth to fully dissolve it into the water.
3. Place the egg gently into the broth and leave without stirring as this will break up the egg.
4. Pour in roughly 500ml boiled water, place the lid on a leave for 3 more minutes.
5. Pour all ingredients into a bowl, or eat straight from the cafetiere (with chopsticks of course).

I made a slight error with this one, which you may have been able to guess from the pictures (in fact I made two errors!). First, I put all the ingredients in the first, and therefore only, batch of water, which meant the noodles didn't cook enough in the given time and were more al dente than I would normally have liked; and secondly, I added the egg far too early and this meant that it broke up and became part of the broth instead of a topping but this did not detract from the flavour... just the presentation, so I'm not too bothered. I have rectified these issues in the recipe so the next batch should be much better ðŸ˜Š

Apart from these minor glitches the recipe was pretty ace, especially considering all I used was boiled water. All the ingredients can be made in advance and also taken into work and placed in the fridge until required; the only special equipment needed is a cafetiere, which are readily and cheaply available in the UK; and the ramen took roughly 15 mins to make and eat, which leaves plenty of time for a leisurely walk during the lunch break to clear ones head and think of zen like ramen thoughts.
