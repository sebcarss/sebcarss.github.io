# Year of Ramen #17: Chicken and Mushroom Ramen with Proper Dashi

## Yay for Amazon!

So, I live in the a place called Liverpool, in the UK. A wonderful place that has an amazing history and some fantastic icons such as The Beatles or the two premiership football clubs or the Three Graces. However, when it comes to Japanese supermarkets, well there just aren't any. There are lots of Chinese supermarkets and even an international food store called Mattas (probably my favourite place in Liverpool) but they have limited Japanese items and this has made my purchase of katsuobushi, slightly difficult. But alas, the one place that never lets me down is the wonderful Amazon. So after a simple search my order was on its way to me ready to be made into a delicious ramen.

## What is katsuobushi?

[gallery ids="2435,2436,2437" type="rectangular"]

Katsuobushi is made from skipjack tuna that has been smoked, fermented and dried so that it has an intense flavour. It is then shaved using a device that looks like a carpenter's plane and used in Japanese dishes to maximise the flavour and it supposedly gives a dashi stock a much deeper body. You might say that Katsuobushi is the Ooh in umami! Well at least that is what I have heard anyway. The only true way to put this to the test is to buy some and make a proper dashi stock with it. So, this post is all about the dashi and giving my ramen the love and care it truly deserves. Therefore,  I wanted to keep the broth as clean as possible so that I could appreciate the subtle nuances of this ingredient. Alas, I've decided to go with a simple soy based broth and to add chicken and mushroom as toppings as well as aonori to add a little colour and bring out the fish undertones a bit more.

# Chicken and Mushroom Ramen with Proper Dashi

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the dashi:_

* 10g kombu
* 15g katsuobushi
* 500g water

_the tare:_

* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sake

_the stock:_

* 500g chicken stock

_the toppings:_

* 6 chestnut mushrooms, sliced
* handful cooked chicken
* 1/2 nori sheet, crushed into small flakes (aonori)

_the noodles:_

* 2 packs of medium egg noodles

## Method

1. To make the dashi brush the kombu with a clean damp cloth or kitchen roll to remove some of the white powder but without wetting the seaweed too much. Then add to a saucepan with the water. Over a medium heat bring up to the point just before boiling then turn off the heat and leave for 5 minutes with the lid  on.
2. Remove the kombu and replace with the katsuobushi. Put back on a medium heat and gently simmer for 5 minutes. Drain through muslin.
3. Clean the saucepan and add the dashi back to it along with the chicken stock and tare ingredients. At this point you can taste the broth to see if it's what you want, you should be looking for something that is slightly salty and sweet with a full body.
4. Shallow fry the mushrooms in a dab of butter over a low heat and when cooked throw in the cooked chicken to warm through.
5. Meanwhile, add the noodles to some boiling water and cook until soft (around 4 minutes). Then drain and divide between the bowls.
6. Place the toppings on top and sprinkle some crushed nori over, then carefully pour the stock into the side of the bowls, being careful not to disturb the toppings.

The verdict? A deeper, smokier flavour was definitely noticeable but did it send me into a new dimension where only me and umami lived in wonderful sensual harmony? Not exactly. Don't get me wrong, it tasted very good and will be an addition to the next few recipes to make sure I get a better understanding of this wonderful little fellow, I just guess I was expecting a bit more. Something to bear in mind with this recipe and review is that katsuobushi is made in Japan, planed into small shavings, packed up and then shipped to the UK via Amazon. This may mean that by the time it reaches my ramen broth it is no where near as fresh as if used in Japan and this may be tainting my view of this iconic ingredient.

As far as the ramen itself goes, it was pretty good. The broth was clean, with a light taste that didn't have any lingering effects and a good body. The chicken and the mushrooms added to the savouriness and the nori compounded the fishy flavour from the katsuobushi. All in all a good ramen to cure a hungered stomach at lunchtime.
