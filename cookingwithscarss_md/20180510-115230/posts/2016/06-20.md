# Year of Ramen #13: Crispy Tofu Ramen with Honey-Ginger Carrots

## Lock, stock & two smoking barrels

For those of you that have followed me on my journey into joyful ramen bliss, you will have noticed that, although I reference using different stocks, I have thus far not created a stock of my own. And those of you that know anything about ramen, know that the stock is one of, if not _the_, key part of a ramen dish, and thus should be taken seriously and not bypassed like I have so far been doing. As you know, my goal is to create 52 delicious and different ramen dishes and blog about them this year (yes, I know, I have some catching up to do!). However, I don't want to, and don't have the time or money to, create a new stock every time I create a ramen dish because ultimately there are so many facets I want to explore with this wondrous creation, like the ajitsuke tamago (soy marinated egg), the different miso soups, the different styles of noodles, and some surprises along the way. All of these add to a deeper understanding of the glorious noodle and a greater connection to my Japanese cousins - I don't actually have any Japanese cousins but I do feel strongly connected to their way of life, so much so that I hope I don't come down with a version of the Paris Syndrome when I go to Japan... eventually!

Today I am going to take a look at one of the great stocks of Japan, one that gives you the true essence of Japan in a bowl. I'm talking about the dashi stock, which involves the use of a type of seaweed known as kombu.

## What is kombu?

Kombu is a type of kelp that is grown in the seas of Japan and Korea but most of the kombu, over 90%, is produced in Hokkaido where the sea ice from Siberia, which is full of minerals, helps to produce the best kombu and impart the rich flavour that makes this such a wonderful ingredient. In fact it contains an extremely large amount of iodine, which is great for growth and development but can cause problems for people with thyroid issues.

## Making dashi

The most common dashi stock involves combining kombu and bonito fish flakes, known as katsuobushi, which is basically dried, fermented and smoked skipjack tuna that is shaved using a wooden plane. However, I want to make this ramen dish vegetarian so I'm going to substitute dried shiitake mushrooms instead. I will make the traditional version another time but for now this will have to do. The basic idea with any dashi is to add the ingredients to a pan, heat until about to boil and then turn off the heat and let it brew for a while. Boiling the kombu can make the broth bitter and slimy, which is not desirable. Some recipes also suggest leaving the ingredients in cold water overnight instead of heating, which I will have to try some time to see if the flavour is noticeably different.

## Tofu

Tofu sounds like it should be a foul ingredient, after all it is curdled soya-milk. I have a two year old daughter and every so often I find a lidded beaker of her milk from a day or two ago hidden somewhere around the house and opening that beaker is sometimes not worth the cost of the beaker due to the stench. However, tofu works! In fact, it has such a mild taste that you almost wonder why you would want to add it to your dish in the first place. But then tofu is a clever little beast of an ingredient that packs a protein punch whilst being unbelievably low in calories. Vegans and vegetarians can get all the amino acids they need from this little beauty without harming a living soul. Fret not though young meat-eaters, this is not just an item for the vegetarians of this world, it is the chameleon of the foodie world and takes on all of the wonderful flavours around it. For this ramen I want it to pack a spicy punch so by rubbing it in cayenne pepper it will absorb that lovely spice and tingle my tastebuds.

Tofu comes in a few forms: silken, firm and extra-firm. The silken variety is wonderful in soups where it is warmed gently in the broth, it is particularly used in a miso soup that is beautifully light and delicious. The firm and extra-firm variety are able to withstand the more brutal methods of cooking, such as shallow or deep frying, and as such can be used in a greater variety of ways. For this ramen I have decided to go with the extra-firm variety as I want to make sure the tofu remains in cubes throughout the frying process. I hope you enjoy my first stock of this series, it is very basic and easy to do so everyone should give it a go, you'll just have to nip to your local Chinese store to find the Kombu, or look online as there are lots of places that sell this, including Amazon!

## Method

1. To make the dashi stock first wipe the kombu with a damp cloth to clean it and then add 1l of cold water to a pan with the kombu and mushrooms and turn the heat on to medium. When the water is about to boil, turn the heat off and leave to cool to room temperature before taking out the kombu and mushrooms.![20160612_124417](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160612_124417.jpg?w=450)
2. Heat the oven to 180C, cut the carrots in half lengthways and place in a bowl with the honey, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar and olive oil. Mix and then add to a roasting tray, cut-side down and roast for 25 minutes. ![20160612_141853](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160612_141853.jpg?w=600)
3. Prepare the tofu by dabbing it all over with kitchen roll, mix the flour and cayenne pepper in one bowl, whisk an egg in another bowl and add the panko breadcrumbs to a third bowl. Dip the tofu cubes into the flour and cover, then dip in the egg and cover and finally dip in the panko breadcrumbs and cover. Set aside for frying later. ![20160612_142050](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160612_142050.jpg?w=600)
4. Toast the sesame seeds briefly in a pan until they have a lovely golden colour to them, but be careful not to burn them, and then transfer to a dish for later.
5. For the broth add the minced ginger and garlic to the dashi stock, along with the sake and soy sauce. Then add the miso to a cup and add some of the stock and mash with a fork until it is dissolved, then add this to the broth and stir. Keep warm but not boiling.
6. Boil the noodles and when ready add to a bowl and pour some of the stock in.
7. Meanwhile, get a heavy based pan really hot with a good amount of rapeseed oil, you want it smoking hot! Then add the tofu cubes and turn to make sure all sides get browned, this should be pretty quick so keep an eye on it. ![20160612_133737](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20160612_133737.jpg?w=600)
8. Finally, add the Chinese leaf to the noodles, place the carrots and tofu on top, add the spring onions and then sprinkle of the toasted sesame seeds and serve.

Oh it's good to be cooking ramen again! This was a great ramen to get back into it because it had a proper stock to make but was also quick enough to make that it didn't require cooking for hours on end. There is something special about a fresh dashi stock, it has a wonderful taste of the sea to it and really gives a subtle depth of flavour to a ramen dish - I can't wait to try the version with katsuobushi in it.

The tofu was delicious! The difference in texture from the soft tofu to the crispy exterior was sublime and the cayenne pepper added a subtle heat to it. My only criticism is I think it needed salt in the flour as well but I shirked this on purpose up front because I figured the broth would be salty enough, so I didn't want to overdo it. The carrots added a contrasting sweet taste explosion that complemented the heat from the tofu really well, it was a real pleasure to find a carrot in the warm embrace of some noodles. A great addition to a ramen dish and well worth the time taken to cook them.
