# Year of Ramen #10: Chashu Pork and Egg Ramen with a Salt Broth

## Chashu

Chashu is the Japanese adaptation of the delicious Chinese char siu pork, in which pork is roastedÂ in honey, five-spice, hoisin and soy sauce. The Japanese version involves rolling the pork belly into a log and braising the meat in soy sauce, sake and sugar, which works wonderfully in ramen. Traditionally the pork belly would be cooked for a few hours, which would tenderise the meat and intensify the flavour, however during my research I stumbled upon a quicker version that I thought I'd try instead, from a blog called [Just One Cookbook](http://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-chashu/). I highly recommend checking that blog out as it has some fantastic Japanese recipes, including some delicious ramen.

I've adapted the recipe slightly to cater for the size of the pan I have, by adding some more water and increasing the other measurements accordingly but the same principles apply. You cook the pork belly in the marinade for about an hour using a cartouche, which is basically a lid that sits directly on to the meat so that the steam trying to escape can't go very far before returning to the lovely meat. You can make a cartouche by cutting foil into a shape the size of your pan and poking a couple of holes in the lid. After about an hour the cartouche is removed and the rest of the liquid is cooked off to form a sticky chashu glaze that gets cooked into the meat and gives it that wonderfully sweet flavour that will punch through the ramen. You'll want to stay close to the meat at this point as it can burn easily and requires constant attention to mop up all that sticky goodness.

The best thing about making chashu... getting to play with my blowtorch! The blowtorch quickly fries the fat causing it to crisp up and causes the Maillard reaction, which is the caramelisation of sugars that ultimately causes food to brown, adding a greater depth of flavour. This is not required, if you don't have a blowtorch, but it does add to the flavour of the meat and is also incredibly fun!

## Back to basics with the egg

I bloody love eggs, they are a wonderful treat at any time of the day, whether it be a poached egg on toast for breakfast, a quiche Lorraine for lunch, or cracked into a carbonara for dinner; there is just something special about these large pearly taste-explosions... and the Japanese know it. I wanted to add them to this ramen because they will add a delicious creaminess as well tempering the sweet and saltiness of the pork, allowing you to go back for more, which can only be a good thing.

However they do come with some problems, of which peeling them is one. The best type are soft boiled eggs butÂ trying to peel a soft boiled egg can be incredibly difficult as the white is very soft and easily breakable, which means instead of a nice smooth surface to the egg it ends up looking like surface of the moon. The chef of Momufuku, David Chang, believes that the 63C sous-vide cooking methodÂ produces the perfect egg, which I agree with, however, my experience thus far has been an egg that is very difficult to peel and has therefore never turned out like in all the recipes that I have read. There must be something that I am missing! Well, according to one blogger, the best way to peel an egg is to bash the bottom of it with a blunt object, like a wooden pestle, before boiling it. One thing to note is the membrane of the egg should not be broken, just the egg shell.Â Well, I like an experiment so I figured I'd give it a go - if you want to find out more details about the blogger's technique check out his post onÂ [No Recipes](http://norecipes.com/recipe/perfect-boiled-eggs), he's another great blogger of Japanese recipes that'd I'd recommend taking a look at.

I've been using the sous-vide to cook my eggs prior to this post but we all know there is nothing wrong with the traditional boiling method, it's just prone to error as a small amount of additional time can turn your silky golden yolk into a solid ball of tasteless sand. So, for this experiment I am going to stick to what Marc from No Recipes has suggested and boil my egg. The problem with this is I haven't done an egg this way for a long time, so I have no idea how long to cook the egg for to make sure I get the perfect runny yolk that I love so much. There is a simple solution to this though, cook 4 eggs and take them out at minute intervals. I've decided to go for the 'residual heat' method, i.e. put your eggs in a pan of cold water and when it boils, switch off the heat and start timing. I used four eggs so I took one egg out at 4 minutes, one at 5 minutes, one at 6 minutes and the last at 7 minutes. You can see from the image the different yolk consistencies going from left to right, with the far left being the 4 minute egg. Personally I think the 4 minute egg was perfect.

## Who doesn't want a carrot sharpener?

One of my friends recently came back from Vietnam on what looked like a fantastic holiday, as you can imagine I was very jealous. Vietnam has, in my opinion, the best breakfast in the whole world, Pho - i.e. beef noodle soup, and I would love to go back to Vietnam to try the real thing once more. Alas, this is not going to happen for a while... I'm still yet to visit Japan, which surely I should visit first and foremost! Anyway, my lovely friend brought me back a couple of gifts, one of them being a tool that would allow me to make flowers out of carrots. This is awesome! It's basically a large pencil sharpener that when used with a carrot causes the shavings to form the shape of a flower.

As you can see, this is a fun tool to add to my kitchen and one that will be used many times during the course of this year of ramen. It's not a requirement for this recipe but it is fun so if you can get hold of one then it's worth it for the presentation i think.

# Chashu Pork and Egg Ramen with a Salt Broth

![20160407_185825](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/20160407_185825.jpg?w=2048)

## Ingredients (serves 2)

<div>_The broth:_</div>

* 1l pork stock
* 1 tsp instant dashi
* 2 tbsp sake
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 2tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp soy sauce

_The toppings:_

* 6 slices of chashu pork (recipe and ingredients below)
* 4 eggs
* 1 lg carrot, grated (for the bottom of the bowl)
* 3 spring onions, sliced finely

_The chashu:_

* 500g pork belly, skin removed with sharp knife
* 1tsp salt
* 4cm piece of ginger, peeled and cut into slices
* 2 spring onions, sliced along the length
* 100ml sake
* 100ml soy sauce
* 3tbsp sugar
* 300ml water

_The noodles:_

* 2 packs of broad chow mein noodles

## Method

_The chashu (made in advance):_

1. Rub the pork in the salt and make sure it's covered all over.
2. Heat some oil in a heavy-based frying pan over a high flame until smoking hot and then add the pork, fat-side down, and cook until the fat is nicely browned, it should take around 7 minutes. Then flip over and cook for a further 3 minutes before transferring the pork to a casserole dish.
3. Add the rest of the chashu ingredients to the casserole dish and bring to a gentle simmer.
4. Create a foil cartouche, with a few small holes in and place on top of the pork, leave to simmer for at least an hour, making sure to turn the pork every so often.
5. When the liquid has nearly all evaporated and turned sticky, take the cartouche off and stir all that sticky goodness into the pork. You want to cook it into the pork but be careful at this stage as if left alone it could burn quite easily.
6. Take the pork out of the casserole dish and slice it into thin slices, then (optionally) use a blow torch to brown up the edgesÂ a bit.
7. You can save the slices in the fridge for a few days or freeze them for a later date, they work particularly well in a yeung chow fried rice ðŸ˜‹

_The egg (made in advance):_

1. Bash the bottom of the eggs with a blunt instrument to dentÂ the egg, without breaking the inner membrane.
2. Place in a sauce pan and add cold water so that it reaches 2cm above the eggs.
3. Bring the pan to boil over a high heat and then switch the heat off and leave to cook for the allotted time you have chosen, personally the 4 or 5 minute eggs were the best.
4. After the time is up, take the eggs and plunge them into water and ice to stop the cooking process. Leave for at least 5 minutes to make sure they are completely cooled and then peel.
5. Place them in bowl and cover them before putting in the fridge until required.

_The ramen:_

1. Add all the broth ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a gentle simmer.
2. Put the grated carrot at the bottom of the ramen bowls.
3. Boil the noodles to package instructions, usually around 4 minutes, drain and then add to the bowls.
4. Fry the chashu slices in oil to cook them through and then add to the bowls.
5. Pour the broth into the bowls.
6. Slice the eggs in two, carefully, and then add to the bowls.
7. Garnish with the spring onions and carrot flower before serving to your lucky guest.

This was one of my best ramen recipes to date! The eggs were amazing to taste and I managed to peel most of them without a hitch; the chashu was wonderfully sweet and really added a punch to the dish; and the noodles were a great change from the norm and will definitely be used again.
