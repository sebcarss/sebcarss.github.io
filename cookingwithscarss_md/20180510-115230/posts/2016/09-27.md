# Year of Ramen #19: Tamagoyaki "Egg Omelette" Ramen

## Roll up, roll up

Today I'm going to be covering a new topping, one that I've made before but never on a ramen, it is known as aÂ _tamagoyaki_ and it is an omelette, but Japanese-style, and therefore amazing! This is made so for two reasons: first, it is square instead of round, which is just plain fun; and second, it is packed full of wonderful Japanese flavours instead of butter and cheese (not that I'm knocking the latter!). To make this dish a special frying-pan is required called aÂ _makiyakinabe_(great name), which is either square or rectangle. The one I own is rectangle, and as you can see it's seen better days (but still works nonetheless)!

## The forgotten powder

In my last postÂ [Year of Ramen #18: Bacon and Eggs Hangover Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/year-of-ramen-18-bacon-and-eggs-hangover-ramen/)Â I was meant to put garlic powder into my broth as part of the tare to see how it compared to real garlic, mainly because I was not in the mood to chop up some garlic. However, in my lazinessÂ I forgot to add anyÂ garlic at all, so I have decided I am going to add it to this broth instead as garlic and egg go well enough together, so surely it will work. I've decided to skip out on the ginger powder though so I can get a full appreciation of the garlic on its own. I'll add ginger powder another day.

## A noodle request

It was brought to my attention by one of my friends that I needed to use a different noodle. I have to admit, I do rely a lot on the egg noodle, mainly because it is easy to cook but I should definitely be using more types of noodles. So for this week I have decided to cook the udon noodle, which is a slightly thicker noodle, which is creamier and much more slippery than its egg noodle cousin.

## Building the final dish

I now need to look at what complements my current ingredients and also what I have in the fridge... which is not much it seems. I have some spinach so I'm going to throw some of that in. It goes well with egg, is good for you and tastes lovely wilted in a bit of butter. I also have spring onions, which is great because they can go on every ramen and give it a freshness that is lovely. I also liked the chilli flakes that I put on the previous ramen, so I'm going to add those again. I don't really have much else at the moment, so I guess that'll have to do. As I haven't got any meat I may as well use that to my advantage and make this vegetarian. So, I'll use a vegetable stock and make a vegetable dashi using dried shiitake and kombu, that should give it a nice umami kick, without adding any fish.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 500g vegetable stock
* 500g vegetable dashi stock

_the dashi stock:_

* 10g kombu
* 20g dried shiitake mushrooms
* 600ml coldÂ water

_the tare:_

* 4g sea salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp mirin
* 2 tsp soy sauce

_the toppings:_

* 6 slices of tamagoyaki
* 100g spinach, wilted in a knob of butter
* pinch of chilli flakes
* 2 spring onions, sliced

_the tamagoyaki:_

* 2 eggs
* 1 spring onion, sliced finely
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* pinch of salt
* pinch of chilli flakes

_the noodles:_

* 2 bundles of udon noodles

## Method

1. First make the dashi by giving the kombu a quick wipe with a damp cloth and then combining it with the shiitake mushrooms and the water in a pan. Gently heat the pan until it starts to simmer and then switch off the heat and leave to stand for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, mix the ingredients for the tamagoyaki and set aside. Also, add the tare to the vegetable stock and set aside waiting for the dashi.
3. To cook the noodles put them into a large pan with some boiled water and apply some heat. When the water starts to boil pour a cup of cold water into the pan to lower the temperature. Keep doing this until the noodles are equally cooked through. Then take off the heat, drain in a sieve and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Add to the bowl.
4. Just before the dashi is ready, add a little oil to the tamagoyaki pan and put on the heat. When hot add a thin layer of the egg mixture to the pan and try to get an even cook on it. Then (using chopsticks for authenticity) fold over the side nearest to you to form a small square, then roll this over to the other side. Then pour another thin layer into the pan and cook evenly again before rolling the egg back the other way. Repeat this until all the egg mixture is used up. Then roll out onto a chopping board and slice into 6 slices before displaying on the plate.
5. Now gently wilt the spinach in a pan with some butter and add to the dish.
6. Sprinkle over some chilli flakes and the spring onions.
7. Using a sieve combine the dashi stock with the vegetable stock and tare mixture and heat to just boiling, then take off the heat and gently pour into the ramen bowl. Retain the kombu for braising at a later date (recipe to follow) or making "second dashi".

Oh yes! These eggs were phenomenal! So much flavour was bursting out of these little slabs that I almost forgot to actually taste the rest of the ramen... almost. Adding spring onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar and chilli flakes to the eggs really gave the eggs a lift and transformed them from a creamy ingredient to something with a bit more balls and something that was very moreish! However, you may have noticed that there is a dark line in the middle of the tamagoyaki that makes the egg look a little like a sponge cake with a chocolate swirl in it? Well, that is not meant to be there, I kinda burnt one of the layers. Oops! It should be a very lightly cooked omelette without any colouring. It still tasted wonderful but next time I will be more careful.

The broth was interesting because I thought when I put the ingredients together on the hob it didn't taste that great, however when it was partnered up with the other ramen ingredientsÂ in the bowl, it was lovely, which just goes to show you should make the broth a little stronger than you would like because the rest of the ingredients will complement it. I think the garlic powder may have been slightly over powering but it did taste alright so for the lazy cook this is a good way to add a little garlic flavour without having to chop anything, just be careful on quantities as a little goes a long way. The vegetable dashi made a huge difference to the flavour of the stock and really brought out the umami in the dish, however I think there should have been a little more salt for my taste.

The thing that let this ramen down was the spinach, that wasn't a great decision. Eggs, butter, spinach, garlic... what's not to love? It just didn't work with this ramen. Maybe it was the clean and clear broth that meant butter was not suitable, or maybe spinach is just too overpowering in itself but it didn't add to the flavour of the ramen, it changed each mouthful to be that of spinach. So, i ended up eating it on its own first to get rid of it and then I could enjoy the real ramen.

It's been a while since I've made a ramen with udon noodles but this was a lovely change. Udon are a little trickier to cook as you have to control the temperature of the water to makeÂ sure that the inside cooks to the same level as the outside, otherwise you can end up with too much bite in the middle and a slippery eel of a noodle on the outside. This is taken care of with a little trick that I read about where you pour a small amount of cold water into the pan just before it boils to stop it from boiling. Anyway, the noodles tasted delicious and were very slurpable (I'm not sure if that is a word but it should be), so much so that I think I should have worn a bib ðŸ˜‚
