# Year of Ramen #20: Beef and Shiitake Mushroom Hiyashi Tsukemen

 

## Winter is coming

When I started writing these posts I had a loosely laid plan to cook traditional ramen in the colder months and experiment with the different variations of ramen in the summer months when slurping down a hot broth would be less appealing. However, time has gotten away from me and I fear I've missed my window of opportunity in this. Luckily I'm not one to worry about change and I'm very happy to make my own path so I've taken my trusty samurai sword and slashed a new window in the shoji (Japanese paper doors). So for this post take yourself back to a time when the sun was out, it was stiflingly hot and you wanted something cooling to eat that would fill you up and put a big smile on your sweaty face.

## What is hiyashi tsukemen

I've already posted about a tsukemen in [Year of Ramen #16: Summer Sun Tsukemen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/year-of-ramen-16-summer-sun-tsukemen/) in which I explained how the difference with this ramen is that you separate the noodles and toppings from the hot broth, and how the noodles are cold. This is great in the summer months but in Japan it supposedly can get so hot and humid that even a tsukemen is too hot to handle. So the inventive Japanese decided to make a cold ramen (hiyashi means cold), whereby cold noodles and toppings are dipped into a cold broth. You may be thinking this is crazy, right? Why would we dip cold noodles into a cold broth in cold Blighty? Well, I can sympathise so I've come up with a cunning plan (m'lord). To authentically enjoy this ramen when living in Britain you may want to turn the radiators onto full blast in the house, close all the windows and doors, go into the bathroom and put the shower on as hot as it will go until the room is nice and steamy and then eat this ramen (it's the only logical thing to do).

## Upping the steaks

In Japan hiyashi tsukemen is sometimes served on a bed of ice to keep the noodles really cold. So the toppings for this dish also need to be able to be served cold, otherwise the whole dish will fall apart, and we wouldn’t want that now, would we? Not after we’ve gone to so much effort in making the house as hot and humid as Japan! So I’m thinking a good slab of cold beef fillet would be perfect. There’s something delicious about opening the fridge and seeing yesterday’s roast beef sitting there waiting to be eaten, with it’s luscious maillard edging and beautifully pink middle. As you can imagine, it doesn’t last long in my house as I’m sure it doesn’t in most people’s houses. For this recipe you can use left over roast beef if you like but I’m going all out on this one and getting a bad boy fillet involved. I’m also going to stick it in the sous vide because it is the best way to cook a steak. Oh this is going to be immense!

## Ultimate man points

My testosterone has now started bubbling at the thought of a succulently pink fillet of beef and as such my head is spinning with all the flavour combinations that would enhance this beast of an ingredient, such as mushrooms, peppercorn sauce, onions, blue cheese, star anise, bacon and chillies. Oh the choice! My spidey senses are telling me that mushrooms, onions and chillies are the right choice for this meal but I may come back to blue cheese as that could be an interesting ramen topping at some point! Mushrooms and onions add a bunch of umami goodness to the meal and that is what I want in my man-points meal. I will use shiitake mushrooms as they have such a wonderful flavour and I will fry the onions so that they add another dimension to the dish - I’m not talking about battered onion rings though as I will be serving them cold, and no one wants a soggy cold onion ring! The chillies will add a nice freshness to the dish and as they will be raw be prepared to have your head blown off when you bite into one (but remember real men don’t feel pain!). Finally, I'll throw on a bit of spring onions for freshness, colour and because they make me smile.

## Be prepared

If all goes well (and I don’t see why it wouldn’t) then this meal is going to be the perfect make-in-advance meal, which means that you can make this the day before and have it at your leisure. I like this kind of cooking, it gives me time to plan other things to cook. When planning a big meal for friends it’s always good to have some things that can be stored in the fridge and pulled out for one of the courses, such as a cold salad starter, or a cake. This gives me time to concentrate on the main course on the night. However, this _is_ the main course so I guess it will give me time to concentrate on some funky starter or even experiment with my ISI whip and create some nice Negroni cocktails. The world is my oyster!

# Beef and Shiitake Mushroom Hiyashi Tsukemen

## Ingredients (Serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 250g beef stock

_the tare:_

* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sake
* 1 clove of garlic, sliced
* 1 inch piece of ginger, sliced
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar
* 2 spring onions, sliced diagonally

_the toppings:_

* 200g beef fillet
* 60g shiitake mushrooms, sliced
* handful of fried onions
* 1 red chilli, deseeded and sliced into rounds (optional)
* 1 spring onion, sliced along the diagonal

_the fried onions:_

* 1 red onion
* 200ml sunflower oil (or another oil with a high smoking point)
* pinch of salt

_the noodles:_

* 2 bundles of udon noodles
* 2 tsp toasted sesame oil

## Method

1. Switch the sous vide on and warm it up to a temperature of 56C (for rare)
2. Take the steak and apply salt liberally all over, then place into a vac sealed bag and pop in the sous vide for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, place all the broth and tare ingredients together and pop in the fridge to infuse.
4. Then put a small knob of butter in a frying pan and heat until bubbling, then add each of the shiitake mushroom slices using tongs. You don’t want to overcrowd the pan because you want the whole surface area of the mushroom to be in contact with the pan to get a nice maillard reaction. Leave the mushrooms for one minute on a medium heat and then turn and leave for another minute (be careful here, if the pan is too hot then the butter will burn and smoke). When both sides are nicely browned take the mushrooms out and drain and cool on paper towels, at this point season with cracked black pepper. You may need to do this in batches.![20161008_103825](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/20161008_103825.jpg?w=600)
5. Clean the frying pan with a paper towel and then add the sunflower oil. Heat the oil until it is very hot, it should be almost smoking. Then put the onion rings into the hot oil using tongs, again make sure you don’t overcrowd the pan so that they don’t stick to each other. Leave until they are just browned but not blackening (about 30 seconds) and then drain on paper towels, sprinkle a little salt over them and leave to cool. You may need to do this in batches. ![20161008_103849](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/20161008_103849.jpg?w=600)
6. When the mushrooms and onions are cool put in a sealed container and store in the fridge.
7. Next cook the noodles in boiled water, making sure that every time the water gets to boiling point again you throw a small glass of cold water into the mix to cool it down. This will enable the noodles to be cooked the same from edge to the centre. Otherwise you could end up with a soft outside and a hard inside. When finished (about 5 minutes), drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Then put into a sealed container with a small amount of toasted sesame oil, toss to coat and then pop in the fridge till later.
8. Once the steak is cooked, take it out of the sous vide and put it straight into a container consisting of half water and half ice (this is to cool it down quickly and safely). Once it is cold, open the packet and pat the steak dry with kitchen roll, carefully making sure the outside is as dry as you can get it. Heat a frying pan with some sunflower oil (or other oil with a high smoking point) and then, when smoking, fry the steaks on each side for 25 seconds and also do the edges. This should give you the browning that we want, if it doesn’t then leave it a bit longer. Once it is cooked, leave it on a paper towel to cool and then pop in the freezer for 10 minutes.[gallery ids="2706,2703" type="rectangular"]
9. Now everything should be ready it’s time to plate up. Get a ramen bowl and place the noodles on it in a mound. Then take the beef out of the freezer and slice it thinly and place on the noodles followed by the mushrooms, the onions, the chillies and spring onions. Finally, take another bowl and pour the cold broth into it.
10. Serve in a hot and humid environment.

Well spank my ass and call me Susan! That was f****** unbelievable! I couldn't have asked for a more delicious start to the day - yep, I had this for breakfast, and if you are wondering how I made all this in good time after waking up, well I made it all in advance and left it in the fridge, so when I woke up all I had to do was plate it up and slurp it down. And boy did it slurp down easily!

The beef was to die for! It was unbelievably delicious and melted in my mouth. The sous vide really is a wonderful invention for cooking a steak to perfection every time. Some people say that the sous vide takes the fun out of cooking and I can see that, but if you want a truly perfect steak every time then there is no substitute. I mean, just look at the picture above again, perfection!

The shiitake mushrooms were another great addition, these were meaty, compounded the umami so my tastebuds were singing and added a slight chewiness that overall added to the textures in the dish. If I were to do them again (and I will), I think I would use a brown butter instead of butter. The reason for this is the smoke. Butter is made of milk solids, water and butterfat, and it is the milk solids that burn when cooked. So by clarifying the butter (i.e. removing the milk solids) you not only stop the butter from burning when cooking the mushrooms, but you also get a lovely nutty flavour as a byproduct of the clarification process. It's a win-win all round really.

The onions were great as well but there were a few that added a slightly too bitter note for me and I think that was down to leaving them too long in the pan. Next time I should be more careful. However, the whole dish including the chillies and spring onions made this work regardless.

And finally, the noodles, udon! Worked a treat. Definitely a good shout in this one as they picked up a lot of flavour. All in all a wonderful dish that I will be doing again at some point, but I will probably just use left over roast beef next time, for ease.
