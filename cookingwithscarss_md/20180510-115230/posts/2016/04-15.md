# Year of Ramen #11: Budget Vegetable Ramen

## Desperate times call for desperate measures

We've all been there, that time of the month when you just need a little extra cash to get you through to the next pay day. For the lucky few out there this is but a fleeting moment but for some people this happens every month and becomes part of the ritual that accompanies a monthly salary. When this unfortunate event occurs and the realisation that there is no food in the fridge hits you smack in the face, there is only one solution to this dire situation - budget vegetable ramen!

Ah, that takes me back! These are the noodles that fed me through the hard times at university, the times when I needed sustenance and only had 6p to my name. I'm not sure I actually got any valuable nutrition from them mind you, but they did do the job until my mum came to the rescue with a box of goodies, thanks mum! Don't worry though, I won't be cooking the noodles in the same way as I did back then. Instead I'll be creating a ramen dish from cheap ingredients that you may find in your freezer and store-cupboard.

## Budget health foods

Is there such a thing as healthy food on a budget? That subject is open to debate but in my opinion the answer is no. The junk food companies have monopolised the market for budget eating by streamlining their factories to produce low-quality food that is high in all manner of nasties. There is no way that farmers can keep their prices as low as these companies can, and that unfortunately means it's cheaper to get processed meat than it is to get healthy fruit and vegetables. However, all is not lost dear reader, just because we cannot beat them, it doesn't mean we cannot create low-cost healthy meals, we just have to be creative.

## Cheap as chips

Whenever I think of cheap ingredients I'm always brought to the same types: root vegetables and frozen food, the problem is these foods are relatively uninspiring. For a budget ramen though they will do just the trick to get some good nutrition in you, as well as filling you up. My first thought when i think about root vegetables and ramen is carrot! Carrots are an essential ingredient to me, they were made for ramen; are hardy, so last a long time; and cost pittance to boot, so these are getting added. When I think of frozen vegetables I can think of none better than the humble pea and sweetcorn medley, these will be a great addition to the ramen as they are nutritious, part of your five a day, last for a long time and are cheap, like the budgie. I'm going to Indulge myself just a little bit with the next two ingredients, the first is the wonderful and versatile egg. Ramen is not really ramen without one and the health benefits are too great to miss out on, especially in a budget ramen where we need all the help we can get. The second are mushrooms, they have no business in this ramen but I absolutely love mushrooms and they don't add too much to the cost of the meal. Ultimately this recipe is showing you what you could do if on a budget, but don't take this recipe verbatim, mix it up a bit, add whatever veg or ingredients you can find... experiment, it's part of the fun!

Total cost: £1.65

Total cost per person: £0.83

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_The broth:_

* _1l vegetable stock (£0.06*)_

_The toppings**:_

* 100g frozen peas (£0.15)
* 100g frozen sweetcorn (£0.22)
* 100g mushrooms, sliced thinly (£0.40)
* 1 lg carrot, sliced thinly (£0.04)
* 2 lg eggs (£0.38)

_The noodles:_

* 2 packs of ramen noodles (£0.40)

* all prices are taken from ingredients found at Tesco

** any spare vegetables will do... it's a good way to use up whatever is left in the fridge

## Method

1. Bash the bottom of the egg with a blunt object to just crack the shell without piercing the inner membrane. Place in a pan and fill with cold water to about an inch above the egg. Bring to the boil and then turn off the heat and set the timer for 5 minutes. When the time is up place the egg into an ice bath for at least 5 minutes before peeling.
2. Boil the kettle and add the hot water to the stock cubes to make the stock. Add to a pan and cook the carrots in for 3 minutes.
3. Add the frozen peas and sweetcorn and bring back to the boil.
4. Meanwhile, fry the mushroom in some oil (or butter).
5. Cook the noodles in boiling water for around 3 minutes, drain and add to a bowl.
6. Top with the vegetables and stock before slicing the egg in two and adding on top.

As you can imagine, this was nowhere near as good as some of the other ramen on this blog. However, it cost 83p per person and it still was a tasty meal that filled me up. There was a little too many peas and sweetcorn if I'm honest, so I'd recommend using a bag of frozen Asian veg if you have that instead. The good thing with using peas and sweetcorn though, is most people will generally have these in their freezer to begin with, and ultimately that is the point of this post - to keep costs down when you are just days away from that coveted income.

The recipe doesn't have to be vegetarian to be cheap either, you could make this with a fish stock, a pork stock, or both; and even throw some crab sticks in, which cost about £1 for 16 and give you some good protein. It's never going to be a gourmet meal, but for a weekday meal when your living on scraps this will taste like heaven in a bowl.
