# Year of Ramen #32: Sesame Ramen with Bacon, Egg and Chinese Leaf

I really enjoyed the last ramen that I made, which involved tahini and miso, and as I happened to have a sesame flavoured Demae Ramen in the cupboard I thought I'd give it another go but this time without the miso (as I'd ran out) and instead some oyster sauce for sweetness and some marmite, for richness.

Marmite, you either love it or hate it, right? Well, not me, I'm on the fence on this one, maybe one of the few people that are. But I find sometimes marmite is lovely, and other times it is just plain disgusting. For example, I can't stand Twiglets, they taste horrendous and yet people seem to not only eat them but actually pay for them too, which I find very odd indeed. However, put marmite on some toast with some butter and it actually tastes pretty good. And whack it into a stew and the umami-ness transcends taste and becomes euphoric. So I think it will be a good substitute for the miso that I have ran out of.

## Ingredients (serves 1)

_the broth:_

* 1 flavour sachet from Sesame flavoured Demae Ramen noodles
* 3 tsp tahini
* 1 tsp marmite
* 2 tsp oyster sauce
* 400ml water
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 heaped tsp corn flour, dissolved in cold water
* 2g instant dashi
* 1 tsp mirin

_the toppings:_

* 1 rasher of bacon, chopped into small bits
* handful of sliced Chinese leaf
* 1 spring onion, sliced on the diagonal
* 1 egg
* pinch of chilli flakes

_the noodles:_

* instant noodles from the Demae Ramen pack

_the tare:_

* seasoned oil from the Demae Ramen pack

## Method

1. Cook the noodles in boiling water until al dente and then refresh under cold running water to stop the cooking process.
2. Add all the broth ingredients to a pan an bring up to a simmer, taste for seasoning.
3. Fry the bacon bits until charred all around and then put into a bowl on the side.
4. Add some boiled water to a small frying pan so that it's an inch deep, turn off the heat and gently break the egg into the water from just above the surface. Leave to stand for 4 minutes or until cooked but a bit wobbly still.
5. Blanch the noodles in boiling water to reheat, drain and then place in a ramen bowl.
6. Pour the broth into the bowl.
7. Blanch the Chinese leaf in salted boiling water for 30 seconds and then place on the noodles to one side.
8. Place the bacon bits on the Chinese leaf.
9. Place the egg on the bacon bits.
10. Sprinkle some chilli flakes over the egg.
11. Place the spring onions to the other side of the bowl and serve.

The marmite worked really well in this and added the expected richness that I was hoping for. I added this last so that I could get the amounts right and found that you can quite quickly spoil a dish by adding too much of this stuff, so I added a little at a time once the broth was heated up, stirred it in then tasted the broth and stopped when it was just right, like when Goldilocks found that third bowl of porridge - hmm... I wonder if in Japan they have a version of Goldilocks and she eats the bear's ramen instead (that sounds like a book worth reading!).

The addition of the oyster sauce seemed to add some sweetness and richness to the dish but I think with the mirin and the marmite, it may not actually be necessary. Still, it tasted delicious and has now proved to me that tahini in a ramen is something to behold.
