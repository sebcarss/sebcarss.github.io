# Year of Ramen #31: Spicy Tahini and Miso Ramen with Bacon, Egg and Mushrooms

Today I feel like exploring some flavours that I haven't used for a while, such as tahini. This sesame paste has never been a staple in my cupboard but when I made [Year of Ramen #16: Summer Sun Tsukemen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/year-of-ramen-16-summer-sun-tsukemen/) I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of it so figured I would give it a go again. I have also been given some eggs from some friends of mine who have chickens so I figured this would be the perfect time to get my poach on, as I'm not going to get fresher eggs than these from the shops.

The rest of the ingredients for this ramen have been ingredients that I just happen to have in the house. So as it is the weekend and I've had some friends round, I have some bacon and mushrooms going spare. These will go nicely with the egg and as I have some spinach I may as well freshen it up with this too. Oh I'm excited already!

# Spicy Tahini and Miso Ramen with Bacon, Egg and Mushrooms

## Ingredients (serves 1)

_the broth:_

* 2 heaped tsp miso
* 1 heaped tsp tahini
* 2 tsp mirin
* small handful of mushrooms, sliced
* half an onion, sliced
* 3g instant dashi
* 400ml boiling water
* 1 tsp chilli flakes
* 1 tsp chilli oil

_the toppings:_

* 2 spring onions, sliced diagonally
* 1 rasher of bacon, sliced into bits
* 1 egg
* small handful of spinach leaves
* nanami togarashi
* sesame dressing

_the noodles:_

* 175g medium egg noodles (because I'm feeling greedy)

## Method

1. Fry the bacon bits on a high heat until charred, then set aside for later.
2. Cook the noodles in boiling water until al dente and then drain and refresh under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside till later.
3. Gently fry the onions in a saucepan with the chilli oil until soft but not browned.
4. Add the mushrooms and fry for a further 3 minutes.
5. Dissolve the miso in a glass with some boiling water then add to the saucepan with the tahini, cook for a minute stirring frequently.
6. Pour in the boiling water, mirin, dashi and chilli flakes, bring to the boil, then gently simmer to keep warm.
7. Meanwhile put a pan on to poach the egg. Bring the water up to the boil then switch off the heat, gently crack the egg into the water and leave for 4 minutes, or until cooked to a soft poach.
8. Blanch the noodles in boiling water and then add to a noodle bowl, piled in the centre if possible.
9. Pour the broth, mushrooms and onions around the outside of the noodles.
10. Top with the bacon bits, spinach, spring onions and then nestle the egg into the noodles as if it were a little nest.
11. Sprinkle over some nanami togarashi and sesame dressing before serving.

This was just plain incredible. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as this as the last time I had this the nuttiness was a little overpowering but as it was in a tsukemen it worked out ok. However, this one was unbelievable. The nuttiness of the sesame gave this dish a real creamy texture and taste, combined with the saltiness of the miso it formed a formidable duo of delectability. I was initially a bit worried about the look of the dish because the tahini starts to break up in the heat of the broth and looks very bitty, almost like sand and water, and the mushrooms and onions ended up looking like they were just covered in wet sand, but because this was poured around the outside, the toppings could cover it up nicely.

The egg was phenomenal, thank you Wyn and Teata for supplying me with this. This is fuelling my desire to have my own chickens now. A simple poached egg works well on this dish because the yolk dribbles into the broth and all down the noodles making them more unctuous but the white is cooked through so can be picked up neatly with chopsticks, an issue that was recently brought to my attention by Wyn when I cooked him a sous-vide egg as part of [Year of Ramen #30: Dashi-Brined Chicken and Egg Miso Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2018/02/25/year-of-ramen-30-dashi-brined-chicken-and-egg-miso-ramen/) - so Wyn, this is the answer.

The raw spinach and spring onions helped to balance out the dish and by putting them on to the broth instead of cooking them beforehand meant that they kept more of their crunch and flavour but could help to flavour the broth by dunking them into it to wilt.

What a weekend of ramen I have had, this being the third in two days! If you are going to do any from this mini series I highly recommend this one, but they all have their merits. Anyway, till next time.
