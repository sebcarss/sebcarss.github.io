# Year of Ramen #30: Dashi-Brined Chicken and Egg Miso Ramen

This weekend my wife has been away and therefore I have the house to myself, which means I have 36 hours to eat as much ramen as I can manage! So far I have already had ramen for lunch and posted about it in [Year of Ramen #29: Pimp My Noodles – Spicy Miso](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2018/02/24/year-of-ramen-29-pimp-my-noodles-spicy-miso/). Next up is dinner and I have friends round for this one so it needs to be a good one, so I'm breaking out the sous-vide and the stock I made in [Year of Ramen #26: Pork Belly and Pickled Shiitake Ramen with Homemade Noodles](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/year-of-ramen-26-pork-belly-and-pickled-shiitake-ramen-with-homemade-noodles/).

Sous-vide chicken allows chicken to be cooked to a medium doneness because the chicken can be held above 54ºC for extended periods of time, in the case of a chicken breast for 1 hour 30 minutes. This means that we can enjoy an incredibly moist breast and removes any chance of having a tasteless, rubbery chunk of meat that requires a sauce to mask its blandness.

> **Why 54ºC?** Between 5ºC and 54ºC (known as the danger zone) the bacteria salmonella, listeria and E. coli start to multiply, which is why fridges hold food below 5ºC. Above 54ºC bacteria stops multiplying and starts to die but it is slow. Sous-vide works by keeping meat above the danger zone for prolonged periods of time allowing all the bacteria to die. At 72ºC the bacteria is instantly killed, which is why traditional cooking methods advise cooking to this temperature but this also dries out the meat in the process.

Brining is the technique of soaking meat in water with a low-salt percentage, around 5% salt to water, to season the meat through to its core. This happens through osmosis. This is one of the key differences between cooking at home and in a restaurant - ever noticed how in good restaurants there is no salt and pepper on the table? That's because the chefs season the food perfectly for you, sometimes through brining. It's one of the easiest hacks you can do at home to make your meat taste better and stop it drying out. Try brining a whole chicken for your next roast dinner and you will notice the difference, or even better try [this recipe from Nigella Lawson](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/spiced-and-superjuicy-roast-turkey) for your next Christmas turkey, it's divine.

A brine doesn't have to just be salty, it can also include other flavours, so I want to try adding dashi to the mix so that this soaks into the meat and gives a solid umami flavour throughout the breast. I also, liked the addition of the cornflour that I used to thicken the broth in my previous ramen so I am going to be trying that again, it makes it feel slightly more authentic, even though it is a bit of a hack.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 800ml [stock](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/year-of-ramen-26-pork-belly-and-pickled-shiitake-ramen-with-homemade-noodles/) (vegetable or chicken stock cubes will do)
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 7g sachet instant dashi
* 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped
* 2cm³ ginger, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp oil
* 2 large fork-fulls of miso, dissolved in a small amount of boiling water
* 1 heaped tsp cornflour

_the toppings:_

* 2 eggs
* 2 dashi-brined chicken breasts
* 1 Chinese leaf, shredded
* 3 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal
* handful of chestnut mushrooms, sliced
* nanami togarashi (optional)
* aonori (optional)

_the dashi-brined chicken breasts:_

* 2 chicken breasts
* 4g instant dashi
* 300ml water
* 15g Maldon sea salt

the noodles:

* 2 packs of medium egg noodles

## Method

1. Mix the water, dashi and sea salt together well and then add the chicken breasts. cover and leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Then wash the chicken under cold water, pat dry with kitchen paper and vac seal.
2. Gently bash the bottom of the eggs with a blunt instrument and place into the sous-vide with the dashi-brined chicken, cook for 1 hour 30 minutes at 63ºC.
3. Meanwhile, cook the noodles in boiling water until just al dente, then refresh under cold water and leave to the side until required.
4. Fry the garlic and ginger in a soup pan with the oil. When softened but not brown add the chicken stock, soy sauce, instant dashi and miso.
5. Dissolve the cornflour in cold water and add to the broth, stir to thicken.
6. Add the Chinese leaf to the broth with the aonori, if using, and leave on a gentle simmer.
7. Fry the mushrooms in a small amount of butter and oil until browned.
8. Blanch the noodles in boiling water (or pour a boiling kettle over the noodles when in a sieve) to reheat. Divide between warmed bowls.
9. Slice the chicken and peel the eggs, then place on the noodles with the mushrooms and spring onions. Then pour over the broth with the Chinese leaf.
10. Sprinkle with nanami togarashi if desired.

This ramen was incredibly tasty, even if it didn't look as appealing as I was hoping (which I put down to the fact I did this when ever so slightly drunk), my mistake was putting the Chinese leaf into the broth and then pouring that over the finished dish, which meant the flaccid leaf covered the presentation of the dish... oops!

That said the flavour of the individual ingredients worked really well, the chicken was just gorgeous and every bite felt like biting into a freshly baked Victoria sponge cake, it was that delicate and moist. The usage of the sous-vide and the brining method upfront really made this as good as it could be. Also, the addition of the cornflour to the broth worked well again so I think I will be using that more often, it's a nice way to give you the feeling of fullness from a ramen dish, rather then the feeling of being full of liquid.
