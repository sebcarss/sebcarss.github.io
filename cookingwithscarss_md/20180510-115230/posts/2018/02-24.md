# Year of Ramen #29: Pimp My Noodles - Spicy Miso

I have a craving for ramen. However, I don't have loads of ingredients in the house and I have limited time before some friends come round to watch the rugby, so I decide to raid the cupboards and see what I can concoct. That's when I come across a little surprise in some instant ramen of the Damae Ramen variety! This is great news for my stomach because it is starting to get unhappy with me. But the problem with instant noodles is they are generally unhealthy due to them being just noodles and a stock. So I have decided to pimp them out with anything else that I can find in the cupboards and fridge.

It just so happens that in the fridge I have some spinach that is on the turn and some Chinese leaf and spring onions (how fortuitous), I also have mushrooms, which I adore so I'm going to throw those in too. Finally, if I am going to pimp this ramen out properly I should really use some staple flavours such as ginger, garlic, miso, dashi and of course soy sauce. Most of these things are readily available in my house at all times so this was a perfect way to give these noodles a real boost of that delicious umami.

The final thing that I wanted to add was corn flour - wait a minute, did this guy just say 'corn flour'? - this may not be very Japanese but I figured it would help to give the feeling that this soup was full of body as it would thicken the broth up, which was something I noticed when I was in a Bone Daddies in London once, their broth seemed so much thicker than mine did. So as this is a cheat's meal in the first place I don't feel too bad for using corn flour to cheat my way to a better body. And anyway, it's all about experimentation right?

## Ingredients (Serves 1)

_the broth:_

* 1 spicy Demae Ramen sachet
* 1 heaped tsp miso
* 3g instant dashi powder
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 heaped tsp corn flour
* 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
* 1 cm³ piece of ginger, finely chopped
* 1 tsp oil
* 400ml boiling water

_the toppings:_

* small handful of chestnut mushrooms, sliced
* small handful of Chinese leaf, shredded
* small handful of spinach
* 2 spring onions, sliced

_the noodles:_

* instant noodles from the Demae Ramen pack

_the tare:_

* oil sachet from the Demae Ramen pack

## Method

1. Cook the noodles in boiling water and then refresh under cold running water to stop the cooking process.
2. Fry the garlic and ginger in the oil and when soft but not coloured put in all the other ingredients except the corn flour and miso and bring to a simmer.
3. Add the miso to a cup and pour some boiling water in, stir with a fork to dissolve and then pour into the broth.
4. Add the corn flour to the cup and pour in some cold water, then mix until all the lumps have gone. Pour into the broth and let cook until thickened.
5. Meanwhile, fry the mushrooms in some oil until softened and slightly browned on the edges. Set aside until ready to use.
6. Throw the spinach and Chinese leaf into the broth and leave to heat up briefly.
7. Blanch the noodles in boiling water to reheat and then add to a bowl.
8. Add the toppings and tare and slurp away.

This was a great cheat's meal that was made pretty quickly with not much in the fridge, which makes it a great versatile dish when you need a ramen fix. This kind of meal goes to show how easy ramen can be and although spending hours and hours over a broth does give a richer flavour, the taste of a meal prepared with instant ramen is delicious in its own right. So if you want a quick fix and can't be bothered with a long broth this is just the answer you need, a pimped up instant ramen.
