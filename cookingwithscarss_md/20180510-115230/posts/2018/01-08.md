# Year of Ramen #28: Spicy Ox Tongue Ramen in a Shoyu Duck Broth

This year of ramen is certainly taking a long time to complete, considering I started it back in February 2016 and it's now January 2018! I may have bit off more than I could chew with this challenge but never mind, I'm still making ramen, just at a more leisurely pace and I'm fine with that. For New Year this year I decided to cook a whole duck using a Rick Stein recipe for Vietnamese braised duck in an orange sauce, it is kind of like the French duck a l'orange but with ballsy spices in, much more to my liking. It worked well and at the end of the meal I was left with a duck carcass that was just screaming to be made into a stock, so I decided to get the pressure cooker out and see what delicious broth I could make with the bones. I wanted to stick to flavours that would work well with the duck but also push towards the Asian cuisines, such as garlic, ginger, chilli and star anise.

Now I have a stock with lots of flavour, I needed to find a good ramen recipe for it to go with, which meant finding an ingredient with a strong enough flavour to tackle the duck - then I remembered I had made some ox tongue for the last ramen that was sitting in the freezer waiting for the day it could snuggle up to a naked egg in a bed of soft noodles and warm up in a steaming hot broth. That day had arrived! I figured mushrooms and Chinese leaf would go well and, as I had some udon noodles lying around I figured this ramen would involve them instead of the usual egg noodles.

## Method

<div>To cook the duck stock:</div>

<div>

1. Put the olive oil in a pressure cooker and heat.
2. Add the garlic, ginger, carrot, onion, celery, chillies and star anise and cook for a few minutes allowing the veg to brown a little to add some depth to the stock.
3. Then put the duck and giblets in and put the lid on, pressure cook on high for 1 hour and then leave to cool naturally.
4. When cool enough to open, pour out the contents into a double-lined sieve over a bowl and mash the veg and meat to get all the juices out.
5. Then put the coriander into the juices and leave to infuse for 15 minutes before discarding.
6. Pour the stock into bags of 150g (individual portions) and freeze for when needed.

<div>To cook the ramen:</div>

</div>

<div>

1. About 1hr30mins before you want to eat the ramen bring the sous-vide up to 63C, gently bash the bottom of an egg to just crack it and then pop it in the sous-vide (it takes 1hr30mins to cook)
2. Put the udon noodles into a pan and pour over boiling water then bring back to a gentle boil on a high heat.
3. As soon as it starts to boil, put some cold water into the pan to slow the cooking process - this will allow the inside to cook at the same rate as the outside, so it is not slimy on the outside and hard on the inside.
4. Keep repeating this process until the noodles are just cooked - a little bite is ok, but not too much.
5. Finally, drain the noodles and cool under cold running water to stop the cooking process. Then leave to one side for later.
6. In the meantime, put the pan back on the hob and fill with boiling water, keep this at a gentle boil for when we want to warm the noodles up again.
7. To make the broth add the duck stock to a pan and warm it through - it will be quite gelatinous, this is good as it will add a lovely untuousness to the finished dish.
8. Add the dashi to the pan along with the soy sauce and mirin and taste to see if it needs anymore seasoning.
9. Keep warm until required.
10. Next do the mushrooms by heating some butter in a pan on a high heat and once melted, add the mushrooms, put a lid on and leave to cook for a couple of minutes so that one side browns nicely but the other side is white, this will add some lovely maillard flavours to the dish.
11. Once the mushrooms are done, remove the mushrooms from the pan and set to one side for later.
12. Add the Chinese leaf to the broth and leave to warm through.
13. Now, using the mushroom pan, add some oil and bring to a high heat before adding the sliced chilli and letting it burn.
14. Add the ox tongue slices to the pan and cook briefly on both sides, in the chilli oil until both sides are brown.
15. Remove the egg from the sous-vide and peel, then pour into a bowl and scoop up with a tablespoon to get rid of the loose white, retaining the tight white and yolk.
16. Finally, plunge the noodles into the boiling water for a few seconds and stir round to speed up the warming process. Drain and put in the bowl.
17. Add the toppings one by one with the egg in the middle.
18. Sprinkle some nanami togarashi onto the egg and serve.

<div>This was a lovely meal that blew away the cobwebs on a hazy Sunday morning. The addition of the chilli was a last minute thing because a friend of mine popped over to pick up a chair and handed me a beautiful looking red chilli, similar looking to a scotch bonnet but more fiery. It was incredibly hot and I (and my family) felt it as soon as it hit the pan - in fact it was so hot it kicked off my asthma! Still, it was a delicious addition to the meal because it gave the ox tongue a real kick.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The broth was delicious. I was a little nervous at how gelatinous the stock was at first because I have been burned by that before when I tried to make [my first tonkotsu ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/year-of-ramen-15-tonkotsu-ramen-with-seared-sesame-tuna/) using trotters. But I have realised the errors of my ways now and diluted the gelatinous broth with dashi instead of eating as is. And the combination of the stock and the dashi really did work well. This gives me more reason to buy a whole duck again as I really don’t like to waste food and making use of the carcass like this was perfect.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>The toppings and the noodles worked well together, the ox tongue had a good kick, the sous-vide egg added a lovely butteriness, the mushrooms added some good umami to the dish and the Chinese leaf added the necessary cleanliness. The noodles locked in the flavour as it was being slurped up and the 8-spice gave the dish an appealing look as well as a little kick (but to be honest it was less noticeable than the ox tongue).</div>

<div> </div>

<div>All in all a good day.</div>
