# Year of Ramen #26: Pork Belly and Pickled Shiitake Ramen with Homemade Noodles

## Fresh is best

Noodles are one of the key ingredients in a ramen, we all know that, but is it really better to have fresh noodles or can we just use the freeze-dried noodles that adorn our supermarket shelves? Is there really a difference or is it like the difference between buying fresh tagliatelle and making it yourself? There's only one way to find out and I think 26 ramen dishes in is the perfect time to do it (well maybe not perfect but any later and people would think I haven't really got my heart in this game!). So how does one go about making noodles, well for starters, it is not the same as pasta. For those of you that think it is similar, you would be wrong. The only thing that makes it like pasta is that it is a dough, which you knead and then put through a pasta machine (or if you are a Jedi warrior then you spin the dough using your bare hands - and mind tricks - to form noodles like this genial fellow).

Unfortunately, I am not a Jedi (or a Sith for that matter), but I do have a pasta machine, so use pasta machine I will.

## Kansui

Pasta involves flour and eggs. Noodles involve flour and water. So what gives noodles the traditional yellow hue? It's a thing called _kansui_, which is a type of water that is found around Asia and contains the minerals potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate - this is the where the magic comes from, it gives the proper colour as well as adding a springiness to the noodles. The problem is it is nigh on impossible to find kansui in the UK, or at least it is from my research so far. However, I have stumbled upon some inventive people who claim to have come up with and answer to at least part of the problem. Enter Harold McGee. This dude has a bit of a scientific brain and has looked into why things work the way they do in the kitchen, in fact, if you watch The Mind of a Chef (David Chang's programme on Netflix) then you will have seen him as he is the strange professor looking dude who explains the science behind the food. He has found that baking soda is sodium bicarbonate but if you bake it at 140C for one hour then it turns into sodium carbonate, which when used in making ramen noodles will result in a very similar noodle to the authentic version. So this is what I must try.

## Momofuku cookbook

For Christmas I received a new cookbook by the chef David Chang, who you may recall me writing about. So it would be rude not to attempt to cook some of the recipes from his book to see how they play out, and how easy they are to do in a home kitchen. And what better recipe to start with than the broth he uses for his ramen? It's a long drawn out process making a broth, because a good ramen takes time, but David makes his in around 8 hours, so I figured that is doable on a first attempt and then it can be refined to my pallet as I learn new things. In my last post [Year of Ramen #25: Roast Pork and Caramelised Kombu Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2017/01/18/year-of-ramen-25-roast-pork-and-caramelised-kombu-ramen/) I showed a picture of all the ingredients that were required for the broth, it is quite a lot but it should yield enough for many future ramen recipes, which will ease the amount of time taken to make ramen for me. I couldn't get the right bones for the job, as my butcher just gave me ribs, however I will be going back and requesting leg bones specifically so that I can see the difference.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 2 pieces of kombu
* 6 litres of water
* 80g dried shiitake
* 1.8kg chicken legs (bone-in)
* 2.5kg pork bones (ask your butcher)
* 450g smoked bacon lardons
* 1 whole bunch of spring onions
* 1 medium onion
* 4 medium carrots

_the tare:_

* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp mirin

_the toppings:_

* 8 slices roasted pork belly
* 2 small amounts of caramelised kombu (see: [Year of Ramen #25: Roast Pork and Caramelised Kombu Ramen](https://cookingwithscarss.wordpress.com/2017/01/18/year-of-ramen-25-roast-pork-and-caramelised-kombu-ramen/))
* 20 slices of pickled shiitake
* 3 spring onions, sliced into rounds

_the roasted pork belly:_

* 1kg pork belly
* 30g Maldon sea salt
* 40g sugar

_the pickled shiitake:_

* 80g left-over shiitakes from making a ramen broth
* 200g sugar
* 225g light soy sauce
* 225g sherry vinegar
* 10 cm knob of ginger

_the noodles:_

* 2 tsp baked baking soda
* 800g type '00' flour
* 300g water, room temperature

## Method

_the broth:_

1. Rinse kombu under running water and then place in an 8-litre stock pot, add the 6 litres of water and bring to a simmer over a high heat, before turning the heat off and leaving to steep for 10 minutes.
2. Remove the kombu and save for making second dashi, then add the shiitake mushrooms, turn the heat up and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Turn the oven on to 200C and when up to temperature put the pork bones in for an hour, turning half way, to brown them.
4. Meanwhile, remove the shiitake with a slotted spoon and save for the pickled shiitake later. Add the chicken to the broth and simmer for 1 hour.
5. Remove the chicken from the broth and discard. Then replace with the pork bones from the oven, which should be nice and brown now, along with the bacon lardons. Simmer for 45 minutes.
6. Fish out the lardons (this is where I realised that using bacon would have been easier) and discard. Then simmer the pork bones for 5 hours (more if your schedule allows - mine didn't).
7. Finally add the spring onions, onion and carrots to the pot for another 45 minutes.
8. Remove all ingredients with a slotted spoon and then strain the broth through a muslin and it is ready to use or frozen for another day.

_the roast pork belly:_

1. Rub the pork belly with the salt and sugar, then place in the fridge (covered) overnight.
2. The next day pour away the excess liquid and cook in an oven at 230C for 1 hour - fat side up. Make sure to baste with any juices in the tray.
3. Turn the oven down to 130C and continue to cook for 1 hour, until tender.
4. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then wrap in foil and place in the fridge to harden. Once completely chilled, cut into 1cm thick slices.
5. Just before serving on the ramen, warm them through in a pan for 1 minute each side.

_the pickled shiitake:_

1. Trim the shiitake stems and then slice the mushrooms to around 3mm think.
2. Add 450ml boiling water, the shiitake, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and ginger to a pan and bring to a gentle simmer for 30 mins.
3. Take off the heat to cool down before removing the ginger and placing into a mason jar to seal.

_the noodles:_

1. In a mixing bowl add the flour, water and baked baking soda and mix together, before kneeding by hand for at least 10 minutes. The dough should feel elastic and smooth at the end.
2. Wrap the dough in cling film and pop in the fridge for 30 minutes.![](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/20170117_111129-collage.jpg?w=300)
3. Using a pasta machine roll out a small amount of the dough at a time, around 250g. Make sure to roll at the widest setting to start, working your way down to the lowest setting, making sure to sprinkle with flour at each step to stop it sticking.
4. Once flattened, change to the tagliatelle adapter and run it through once more to make noodles, make sure to add flour to stop it sticking.
5. Bundle them up in 170g portions and then wrap each in cling film, store in the fridge or freezer.
6. When it is time to cook them, pop them in a pan of boiling water, with some salt, for around 5 minutes, or until tender but with a little bite.

_putting it together:_

1. Divide the soy sauce and the mirin between two bowls.
2. Heat the broth to a simmer.
3. Gently fry the pork belly slices to reheat in a little oil.
4. Place the cooked noodles into the bowls.
5. Add the broth, caramelised kombu, pork belly slices, pickled shiitake and spring onions.

My word that took a long time to make a ramen! In total, due to not being able to slave away for a full day, I had to wait 6 days for this ramen. Was it worth it? Hmm... I really want to say yes but I would be partially lying if I did. It was very tasty indeed but I've had ramen using an instant dashi and a stock cube that tasted pretty good too so I can't really say this was worth all the effort, however it was better in someways.

The stock had a much greater depth of flavour than any of the stocks I've used for ramen so far. It had a subtle smokiness that imparted just enough flavour to the noodles and made the ramen smell wonderful but it didn't over power it, and it let the other flavours have a go at wooing my tastebuds - which they did! The ribs seemed to work as far as I am concerned, they gave the broth the body that it deserved, however, as I have never actually tried a ramen broth using actual pork leg bones, I realise that maybe David is right, and maybe this broth is anaemic in comparison... only time (and another long day) will tell.

Eating a pickled shiitake mushroom was like being kissed by Princess Toadstool after she has been rescued from the clutches of the dreadful Bowser himself, by the extraordinary duo that are the Mario Bros. They were so sweet but they also packed a punch and left you wanting another one as soon as possible. A great way to use up excess shiitake mushrooms and as I was eating them I was already thinking about how perfectly they would go on an umami packed burger! One for another post.

The roast pork was pretty good but it wasn't anything to write home about (he says whilst writing a post about it). I think dry roasting the meat wasn't the best idea and to be honest I'm a little surprised that Mr Chang does it this way when it is more typical to use chashu, which is braised rather than roasted. It was a little too dry for me but the flavour was lovely, it wasn't too salty, which was a concern at first and it wasn't too sweet either. The Maillard reaction around the edges was lovely and added some depth to the dish but unfortunately in some places that reaction went a little too far and it tasted a wee bit burnt. I think next time I will go with the Coca-Cola version and see how that goes.

Unfortunately the thing that I was most excited about was the noodles and these didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. Making the noodles feels great, it's relatively easy to do, except for the mammoth amount of kneading that I had to do (I really need to get a Kitchen Aid!), but I fall foul when it comes to storage. For some reason, that I don't know yet, and this happens with pasta that I make too, once I put the noodles into a bag and pop them in the fridge or freezer, they start to stick together again and make it difficult to cook. As already mentioned, it took me 6 days before I could find the time to eat this ramen, so I had to store the noodles in the freezer, and when I cooked them they didn't unstick from each other as much as I would have liked, in fact, the ramen nearly resembled a Frankenstein's Minestrone. All was not lost though, the flavour was pretty damn good, the texture was like silk and I can now see why fresh noodles are better. As far as colour goes they were not as yellow as I expected either, maybe I needed to bake the baking soda more.

Not much to say about the rest of the ingredients that I haven't already said before, except that as a combination of toppings they all worked well. There were differing levels of sweetness, a little sourness, a good dollop of saltiness in the broth and a ruck load of umami assaulting my tastebuds. I am pretty happy with the outcome of this ramen and it has really made me appreciate how much love and attention goes into making true ramen as this one took a good portion of just one day (even if it did take 6 days to actually eat it).
