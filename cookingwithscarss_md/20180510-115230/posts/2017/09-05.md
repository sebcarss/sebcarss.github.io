# Year of Ramen #27: Sous-Vide Ox Tongue Ramen

## Tongue in cheek

I am a big believer in trying anything once to see whether I like the taste or not, trying it twice just in case my taste buds were having an off day, and in the case of olives, trying every single time they are laid out in front of me, as they always look so deceptively delicious; and this generally works out ok for me. In the case of the olives I have had some absolutely delicious olives over the years so it was worth the pain just for those. However, whenever I see something I haven't tried before I will automatically want it and want to learn how to cook it. This was the case recently, when I was at my local, travelling farmers' market and one of the butchers had a rather large hunk of meat with a label on saying "Ox Tongue Â£3.50". Well, I was flabbergasted to say the least, firstly I'd never seen an ox tongue like this before, so I didn't realise just how big they were, and secondly the cost was an absolute bargain. Obviously I had to buy this and so I did, although my wife did mention she probably wouldn't have any, which means more for me! So, check out this bad boy, which is now going to form part of a new ramen...

## Sealed with a kiss

"How on earth does one cook a tongue?", you may be thinking, and that was what I was thinking when I bought the thing. My instinct told me it would be a tough cut of meat and therefore require some very long and slow cooking, because well used muscle is always more tough than soft lazy muscle, just think of the difference between braising steak, which is taken from near the leg muscles, and fillet steak, which is taken from the very middle of the cow, away from all major moving parts. As the tongue is firmly centered in the mouth and the cow spends most of their time chewing, I figured this is going to be one for the sous-vide, and after a little bit of research it turns out this is a pretty good way to get the best out of this cheap cut. So, I will build a ramen around this one ingredient, which means something ballsy to compliment the rich beefiness, here goes.

## Method

_the ox tongue:_

1. Set the sous-vide to 76C
2. Rub the ox tongue with the salt and pepper, then place in a vac-sealable bag, add the beef dripping and vac-seal.![](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/20170822_205915-collage.jpg?w=768)
3. Place in the sous-vide and leave for 36 hours (between 24-48 hours will make it tender).
4. When it is cooked take it out and plunge it into a water bath of half water and half ice, leave it for 15 minutes to stop the cooking process.
5. When it is cool, cut open the bag, retaining the juice for a kick to your next gravy, carefully peel off the tough outer skin of the tongue and then slice into thin rounds.
6. Vac-seal the tongue slices and place in the fridge until they are required (or freeze if not being used straight away).

_the clarified butter:_

1. Put the butter into a heavy milk pan and set on a low heat.
2. Stir frequently to ensure it doesn't burn when it separates.
3. When it is fully separated but not browned, take the butter off the heat and strain it through a muslin. Discard the milk solids in the muslin.

_the demi-glace:_

1. Heat the clarified butter, carrot, onion and celery in a large heavy saucepan, and cook over medium heat until softened but not browned.
2. Add the flour and stir to form a paste, then cook, stirring frequently until a little brown.
3. Add 1l of the beef stock and the thyme, bay leaf, parsley and peppercorns, bring to the boil and then simmer for around 15 minutes, or until the broth has reduced by about half.
4. Strain the broth using a fine-meshed sieve or muslin and then put back in the pan with the rest of the stock.
5. Bring to the boil again and simmer for 40 minutes or reduced by half again.
6. Take off the heat and leave to cool ready for the next step.

_the broth:_

1. Boil some water and mix a small amount of the water with the miso to make a runny paste.
2. Put the water, demi-glace and miso paste mix into a pan along with the soy sauce and heat until just boiling then take off the heat. Taste to check seasoning, it should be very beefy and slightly salty, adjust as required.
3. Keep warm until required, or chill and keep in the fridge until you make your ramen.

_putting it all together:_

1. Brush the ox tongue with the hoisin sauce and leave to one side for later.
2. Peel and mince the garlic and ginger, slice the spring onions and then fry them gently with oil in a pan to soften.
3. Slice the pak choi along the length and break apart some of the enoki mushrooms before placing in the pan and stirring to pick up the flavours. Keep cooking for a few minutes, until softened but not brown.
4. Pour in the broth at this point and bring back to a very gentle simmer.
5. In the meantime, start cooking the noodles in boiling water, for around 4 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, gently fry the tongue on one side for about 30 seconds to just heat through (this step can be skipped if the tongue is sliced thin enough).
7. Then drain the noodles and place in the bowls.
8. Put the ox tongue to the side along with the nori.
9. Using chopsticks pick out the mushrooms and pak choi and place on the noodles.
10. Add the green parts of the spring onions, then pour over the broth

That is a ramen to behold! The broth was just devine, and had such a great look about it, as if it was dancing, almost mesmerising, which was the miso enticing me to dive in and get involved, which I did with gusto. The demi-glace made a mammoth amount of difference to the end result, where flavour is concerned anyway, because this broth had a good body to it, which I'd not really tasted before, apart from when I went down to London and ate at some ramen restaurants. I think the demi-glace combined with the miso really made the difference here compared to some of my other broths that I have made. And I have to admit, making the demi-glace using stock cubes instead of boiling the bones for hours on end was so much easier. I mean, although I love cooking, trying to find the time to cook a stock with all the bones is very difficult when I have a 3 year old and a 3 month old that I want to play with when I'm at home. Still, this blog is my journey into the wonderful world of ramen and this broth did me proud.

The tongue was interesting... on its own it kind of tastes like corned beef, i.e. beefy with a slight offal undertone, the sous-vide did the trick in breaking down this tough cut and making it deliciously melt-in-the-mouth soft, and the hoisin sauce added a lovely sweetness to the tongue, which complimented the meatiness as well as the broth. It just about held its own when pinched with the chopsticks, which was perfect as it allowed me to easily break it down without requiring none of that Western cutlery. I think the brief heating in the pan was the right idea, but mainly because I accidentally cut the tongue too thick, if it was thinner then maybe having it cold would have been ok as the broth would have heated it up more easily.

As for the toppings, you can't really go wrong with mushrooms and pak choi when beef is concerned so these worked well in this ramen. The mushrooms added a rich umami hit that accentuated the deep mesmerising broth and the pak choi added the freshness that cut through the richness just at the right time, so that the next bite of ramen could take you on the journey up to umami heaven once more.

I highly recommend giving this ramen a go, it was pretty simple to make and very tasty. If you don't have a sous-vide or can't find ox tongue (or indeed don't fancy the sound of it) then a good fillet steak, flash fried and then sliced thinly will work wonders as well.
