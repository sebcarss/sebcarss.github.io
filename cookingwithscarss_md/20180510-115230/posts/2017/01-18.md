# Year of Ramen #25: Roast Pork and Caramelised Kombu Ramen

## A not so unexpected ramen

I've mentioned before that making ramen is not a simple task, although it can be if you just want a quick dinner. However, for a real lover of ramen there is no substitute to trying to make every part of the ramen with all the tender love and care that it deserves. But when does one get the time to spend 6 or more hours tending to a pot of boiling bones? Well, luck would have it that I was working a late shift tonight, which meant I had up until 3pm to get my cook on! These days are like gold dust... a whole day where I can just cook, listen to music, whistle and dance around the room like an idiot with a big grin on my face. So, with the unbounded excitement of a child on Christmas Eve I marched myself to the shops on Ramen Broth Eve (that's what I'm calling the day before today) to buy some much needed ramen broth ingredients. I'm then setting my alarm for 5:30 to make sure my broth is on by 6am. Today, is going to be a very good day indeed!

![20170117_060353](https://cookingwithscarss.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/20170117_060353.jpg?w=2048) There are 10 hours till I'm in work, I've got 6 kilos of meat, 80 grams of shiitake, a lot of kombu, it's dark and I'm wearing sunglasses. Hit it!

My initial thought was to make a broth and then make a ramen using that broth, but I didn't quite think through how long it would take to make the broth and my timings with when lunch was. Which meant I could spend all day cooking ramen and not actually get to eat any ramen, which as you can imagine would be a terrible state of affairs indeed! Luckily, my fridge contained a lot of items that could be combined into a new ramen than I originally expected, so I decided to make an impromptu ramen for eating, instead of the intended ramen, which will appear in the next blog (maybe).

## Mixing up my misos

In some of my previous recipes I have used a miso called hatcho miso, which is lovely and salty, but I've been reading that strong misos like hatcho are more commonly mixed with a white miso (shiro) to form a blend known as awasi miso. As I happened to have both misos in my fridge due to an impromptu purchase at my local M&S, I decided that I would give this a go. I was kind of in a rush to eat something at this point though, as it was a natural break between putting the chicken into the stock to release its flavour and the pork bones in the oven to maximise its flavour. So, I decided to use a mixed broth as well - both chicken stock and instant dashi.

## New cookbook

When I first told people that I was going to write 52 ramen recipes a lot of people were a bit confused at how I would be able to think of that many different ramen recipes. Well, I've been acquiring new cookbooks about noodles to help me with this task. In fact, it's starting to become quite addictive now, so much so that I'm actually going to [https://www.amazon.co.jp/](https://www.amazon.co.jp/) as they will have better ramen books than I can get in the UK. There is the small issue of the language barrier but there's nothing like a ramen cookbook to get me to learn the language so I can decipher the instructions to unlock the delicious recipes! Anyway, one of the cookbooks I now have is called Nanban and it has a recipe for braised kombu, which is where leftover kombu, that has been steeped in boiled water for a dashi, is cooked in soy sauce, mirin, rice wine vinegar and sugar to make a lovely caramelised dish. Luck would have it that I had just used some kombu to make a dashi for my broth, so instead of discarding the kombu, I made it into caramelised kombu for this ramen. What an interesting treat! I love it when I can reuse food for other purposes, makes me feel happy. In fact, one of the other ingredients in this ramen is leftover pork from my Sunday roast. Yay... bonus points for not wasting food. My gran would be very happy with me right now. Let's see how this goes then.

# Roast Pork and Caramelised Kombu Ramen

## Ingredients (serves 2)

_the broth:_

* 1 tbsp hatcho miso
* 1 tbsp shiro miso
* 1 chicken stock cube
* 5g instant dashi

_the tare:_

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tsp rice wine vinegar

_the toppings:_

* Leftover roast pork, sliced into squares
* Caramelised kombu
* 2 eggs
* 4 spring onions, chopped into small rounds
* 10 small pickled gherkins

_the caramelised kombu:_

* 2 pieces of rehydrated kombu (i.e. previously used to make dashi)
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tsp rice wine vinegar
* 400ml water
* 2 tsp sesame seeds

_the noodles:_

* 4 packs of instant noodles (because one each is just not enough!)

## Method

1. To make the caramelised kombu: slice the kombu into thin strips, then put in a pan with the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, rice wine vinegar and water. Bring to the boil and then turn down to just above a simmer and reduce until thick and sticky. Then add the sesame seeds.
2. To make the soft boiled egg (onsen tamago): gently bash the fat end of the egg with a blunt object to slightly crack the egg - this will help with peeling later. Add the egg to a pan and cover with cold water. Cover the pan and put on a high heat and when it just comes to boil, turn off the heat and leave for 4 minutes. As soon as it is ready, run it under cold water, peel, slice and add to the bowl - make sure the noodles are ready for this last bit.
3. To make the broth: mash the two misos with a fork in a small amount of boiled water to dissolve it, then pour this into a sauce pan with the chicken stock and instant dashi. Mix everything together, add the tare ingredients and then taste to check seasoning. Keep warm.
4. Boil the noodles as the packet suggest, should only take 3-4 minutes, then drain and add to the bowl.
5. Add a tablespoon of soy sauce and mirin to a frying pan and fry the pork gently in this to warm through.
6. Assemble the toppings in the bowl. Pour in the broth.

This was both good and bad. The broth itself wasn't particularly appealing, there was something too bitter about it that stuck with me for a while. What was strange was eating it with the ingredients seemed to work for me, but the aftertaste was not nice. The caramelised kombu was a pure joy though! Maybe this was the key to enjoying the broth because of its sweetness as it was delicious. It had just the right amount of bite to it so that it wasn't mushy but it also wasn't difficult to eat, like a slightly more than al dente pasta. The sticky sweetness was well received with the pork, as I'm sure you can imagine, it's very similar to caramelised red cabbage, which is just a wonderful addition to a porky Sunday roast. I will be making this again.

Surprisingly the gherkins didn't add as much pizazz to the dish as I thought it would, they kind of got lost in all the other flavours. Maybe it was because I added the rice wine vinegar to the broth and therefore I needed something sweet to cut through the sour instead of more sour?! The egg did well, which I never doubted, but I left it in the pan for a little too long and it was a little overcooked for my liking. I didn't have time for the sous-vide this time so thought I'd go all conventional, which failed.

The pork worked really well, it was only lightly fried to warm it up but the addition of the mirin and soy sauce gave it a slight glazing which in turn gave it a new lease of life. It wasn't the star of the show, but it is leftovers and it went down a treat regardless. I added quite a lot of spring onions to this dish because I wanted to give the dish a really fresh feel. In Vietnam they have a national dish called Pho, where lots of coriander, basil and mint are added to the noodle dish and it really lifts it. I thought this would have a similar effect and I wasn't wrong. I could smell the spring onions before the broth, which was beautiful. Maybe a dash of toasted sesame oil wouldn't have gone amiss but by this point I was too excited to wait any longer.
